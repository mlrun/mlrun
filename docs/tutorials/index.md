## Cheat sheet

If you already know the basics, use the [cheat sheet](../cheat-sheet.html) as a guide to typical use cases and their flows/SDK.

## Running the demos in Open Source MLRun

By default, these demos work with the online feature store, which is currently not part of the Open Source MLRun default deployment:
- fraud-prevention-feature-store 
- network-operations
- azureml_demo
