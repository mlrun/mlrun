    "Nuclio is a high-performance \"serverless\" framework focused on data, I/O, and compute intensive workloads. It is well integrated with popular \n",
    "data science tools, such as Jupyter and Kubeflow; supports a variety of data and streaming sources; and supports execution over CPUs and GPUs. \n",
