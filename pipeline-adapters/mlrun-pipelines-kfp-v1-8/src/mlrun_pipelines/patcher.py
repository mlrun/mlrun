# When we run pipelines, the kfp.compile.Compile.compile() method takes the decorated function with @dsl.pipeline and
# converts it to a k8s object. As part of the flow in the Compile.compile() method,
# we call _create_and_write_workflow, which builds a dictionary from the workflow and then writes it to a file.
# Unfortunately, the kfp sdk does not provide an API for configuring priority_class_name and other attributes.
# I ran across the following problem when seeking for a method to set the priority_class_name:
# https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/issues/3594
# When we patch the _create_and_write_workflow, we can eventually obtain the dictionary right before we write it
# to a file and enrich it with argo compatible fields, make sure you looking for the same argo version we use
# https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/release-2.7/pkg/apis/workflow/v1alpha1/workflow_types.go
