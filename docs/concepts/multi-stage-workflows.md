# Workflows

A workflow is a definition of execution of functions. It defines the order of execution of multiple dependent steps in a DAG. A workflow 
can reference the projectâ€™s params, secrets, artifacts, etc. It can also use a function execution output as a function execution 
input (which, of course, defines the order of execution).

MLRun supports running workflows on a `local` or [`kubeflow`](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/overview/pipelines-overview.html) pipeline engine. The `local` engine runs the workflow as a 
local process, which is simpler for debugging and running simple/sequential tasks. The `kubeflow` ("kfp") engine runs as a task over the 
cluster and supports more advanced operations (conditions, branches, etc.). You can select the engine at runtime. Kubeflow-specific
directives like conditions and branches are not supported by the `local` engine.

Workflows are saved/registered in the project using the {py:meth}`~mlrun.projects.MlrunProject.set_workflow`.  
Workflows are executed using the {py:meth}`~mlrun.projects.MlrunProject.run` method or using the CLI command `mlrun project`.
