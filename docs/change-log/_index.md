## v1.2.1

### New and updated features

#### Feature store
- Supports ingesting Avro-encoded Kafka records. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/issues/2649).

### Closed issues
- When running a workflow with `local=True`, the serving function is updated. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/issues/2716).

## v1.2.0

### New and updated features

#### Artifacts
- Support for artifact tagging:
   - SDK: Add `tag_artifacts`  and `delete_artifacts_tags` that can be used to modify existing artifacts tags and have 
    more than one version for an artifact.
    - UI: You can add and edit artifact tags in the UI.
    - API: Introduce new endpoints in `/projects/<project>/tags`.
    
#### Auth
- Support S3 profile and assume-role when using `fsspec`.
- Support GitHub fine grained tokens.

#### Documentation
- Restructured, and added new content.

#### Feature store
- Support Redis as an online feature set for storey engine only. (See [Redis target store](../data-prep/ingest-data-fs.html#redis-target-store).)
- Fully supports ingesting with pandas engine, now equivalent to ingestion with `storey` engine (TechPreview):
   - Support DataFrame with multi-index.
   - Support mlrun steps when using pandas engine: `OneHotEncoder` , `DateExtractor`, `MapValue`, `Imputer` and `FeatureValidation`.
- Add new step: `DropFeature` for pandas and storey engines. (TechPreview)
- Add param query for `get_offline_feature` for filtering the output.

#### Frameworks
- Add `HuggingFaceModelServer` to `mlrun.frameworks` at `mlrun.frameworks.huggingface` to serve `HuggingFace` models.

#### Functions
- Add `function.with_annotations({"framework":"tensorflow"})` to user-created functions.
- Add `overwrite_build_params` to `project.build_function()` so the user can choose whether or not to keep the 
build params that were used in previous function builds.
- `deploy_function` has a new option of mock deployment that allows running the function locally.

#### Installation
- New option to install `google-cloud` requirements using `mlrun[google-cloud]`:  when installing MLRun for integration 
with GCP clients, only compatible packages are installed.

#### Models
- The Labels in the **Models > Overview** tab can be edited.

#### Third party integrations
- Supports Confluent Kafka (Tech Preview).

#### Internal
- Refactor artifacts endpoints to follow the MLRun convention of `/projects/<project>/artifacts/...`. (The previous API will be deprecated in a future release.)
- Add `/api/_internal/memory-reports/` endpoints for memory related metrics to better understand the memory consumption of the API.
- Improve the HTTP retry mechanism.
- Support a new lightweight mechanism for KFP pods to pull the run state they triggered. Default behavior is legacy, 
which pulls the logs of the run to figure out the run state. 
The new behavior can be enabled using a feature flag configured in the API.

### Breaking changes

- Feature store: Ingestion using pandas now takes the dataframe and creates indices out of the entity column 
(and removes it as a column in this df). This could cause breakage for existing custom steps when using a pandas engine.

### Closed issues

- Support logging artifacts larger than 5GB to V3IO. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/issues/2455).
- Limit KFP to kfp~=1.8.0, <1.8.14 due to non-backwards changes done in 1.8.14 for ParallelFor, which isn’t compatible with the MLRun managed KFP server (1.8.1). [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/issues/2516).
- Add `artifact_path` enrichment from project `artifact_path`. Previously, the parameter wasn't applied to project runs when defining `project.artifact_path`. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/issues/2507).
- Align timeouts for requests that are getting re-routed from worker to chief (for projects/background related endpoints). [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/issues/2565).
- Fix legacy artifacts load when loading a project. Fixed corner cases when legacy artifacts were saved to yaml and loaded back into the system using `load_project()`. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/issues/2584).
- Fix artifact `latest` tag enrichment to happen also when user defined a specific tag. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/issues/2572).
- Fix zip source extraction during function build. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/issues/2588).
- Fix Docker compose deployment so Nuclio is configured properly with a platformConfig file that sets proper mounts and network 
configuration for Nuclio functions, meaning that they run in the same network as MLRun. 
[View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/issues/2601).
- Workaround for background tasks getting cancelled prematurely, due to the current FastAPI version that 
has a bug in the starlette package it uses. The bug caused the task to get cancelled if the client’s HTTP connection 
was closed before the task was done. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/issues/2618).
- Fix run fails after deploying function without defined image. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/pull/2530).
- Fix scheduled jobs failed on GKE with resource quota error. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/pull/2520).
- Can now delete a model via tag. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/pull/2433).

## v1.1.3

### Closed issues

- The CLI supports overwriting the schedule when creating scheduling workflow. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/pull/2651).
- Slack now notifies when a project fails in `load_and_run()`. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/pull/2794).
- Timeout is executed properly when running a pipeline in CLI. [View in Git]https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/pull/2635).
- Uvicorn Keep Alive Timeout (`http_connection_timeout_keep_alive`) is now configurable, with default=11. This maintains 
API-client connections. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/pull/2613).
