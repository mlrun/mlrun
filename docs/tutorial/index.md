# Tutorials and Examples

The following tutorials provide a hands-on introduction to using MLRun to implement a data science workflow and automate machine-learning operations (MLOps).

Make sure you start with the [**Quick Start Tutorial**](./01-mlrun-basics.html) to understand the basics.

Each of the following tutorials is a dedicated Jupyter notebook. You can download them by clicking the `download` icon at the top of each page.
