# Tutorials and examples

The following tutorials provide a hands-on introduction to using MLRun to implement a data science workflow and automate machine-learning operations (MLOps).

Make sure you start with the [**Quick start tutorial**](./01-mlrun-basics.html) to understand the basics.

Each of the following tutorials is a dedicated Jupyter notebook. You can download them by clicking the `download` icon at the top of each page.

## Running the demos in Open Source MLRun

By default, these demos work with the online feature store, which is currently not part of the Open Source MLRun default deployment:
- fraud-prevention-feature-store 
- network-operations
- azureml_demo
