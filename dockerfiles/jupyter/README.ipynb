    "MLRun **simplifies & accelerates** the production pipeline design using a modular strategy, where the different parts contribute to a continuous, automated, and far simpler path from research and development to scalable production pipelines, without refactoring code, adding glue logic, or spending significant efforts on data and ML engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "MLRun uses **Serverless Function** technology: write the code once, using your preferred development environment and simple “local” semantics, and then run it as-is on different platforms and at scale. MLRun automates the data processing and movement, build process, execution, scaling, versioning, parameterization, outputs tracking, CI/CD integration, deployment to production, monitoring, and more.\n",

Alternatively, you can use [Iguazio's **managed** MLRun service](https://www.iguazio.com/docs/latest-release/).\n",

    "This Jupyter Notebook server is designed to work with the different options, it works out of the box with the **local** deployment mode.<br> \n",
    "In order to work with remote MLRun service (Kubernetes or managed) you need to edit and save the [**mlrun.env**](./mlrun.env) file in the following way:\n",

    "**Once You are done, save the file using the menu or `ctrl + s`, you may need to restart existing Notebooks for the changes to take effect.**"
