## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

1. Install MLRun locally.

    You need to install MLRun locally and make sure the that the MLRun version you install is the same as the MLRun service version. Install a specific version using the following command; replace the `<version>`  placeholder with the MLRun version number (e.g., `0.5.4`):
 
    ```sh
    pip install mlrun==<version>
    ```

    If you already installed a previous version of MLRun, you should first uninstall it by running:

    ```sh
    pip uninstall -y mlrun
    ```

2. Ensure that you have remote access to your MLRun service (i.e., to the service URL on the remote Kubernetes cluster).

## Configure Remote Environment

### Set Environment Variables

Set environment variables to define your MLRun configuration. As a minimum requirement:

1. Set `MLRUN_DBPATH` to the URL of the remote MLRun database/API service; replace the `<...>` placeholders to identify your remote target:

    ```ini
    MLRUN_DBPATH=<API endpoint of the MLRun APIs service engpoint; e.g., "https://mlrun-api.default-tenant.app.mycluster.iguazio.com">
    ```
    
2. In order to store the artifacts on the remote server, you need to set the `MLRUN_ARTIFACT_PATH` to the desired root folder of your artifact. You can use `{{run.project}}` to include the project name in the path `{{run.uid}}` to include the specific run uid in the artifact path. For example:

    ```ini
    MLRUN_ARTIFACT_PATH=/User/artifacts/{{run.project}}
    ```

3. If the remote service is on an instance of the Iguazio Data Science Platform (**"the platform"**), set the following environment variables as well; replace the `<...>` placeholders with the information for your specific platform cluster:

    ```ini
    V3IO_USERNAME=<username of a platform user with access to the MLRun service>
    V3IO_API=<API endpoint of the webapi service endpoint; e.g., "https://default-tenant.app.mycluster.iguazio.com:8444">
    V3IO_ACCESS_KEY=<platform access key>
    ```

    You can get the platform access key from the platform dashboard: select the user-profile picture or icon from the top right corner of any page, and select **Access Keys** from the menu. In the **Access Keys** window, either copy an existing access key or create a new key and copy it. Alternatively, you can get the access key by checking the value of the `V3IO_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable in a web-shell or Jupyter Notebook service.

## IDE Configuration

## Remote Environment from PyCharm

You can use PyCharm with MLRun remote by changing the environment variables configuration.

1. From the main menu, choose **Run | Edit Configurations**.

    ![Edit configurations](../_static/images/pycharm/remote-pycharm-run_edit_configurations.png)

2. To set-up default values for all Python configurations, on the left-hand pane of the run/debug configuration dialog, expand the **Templates** node and select the **Python** node. The corresponding configuration template appears in the right-hand pane. Alternatively, you can edit a specific file configuration by choosing the corresponding file on the left-hand pane. Choose the **Environment Variables** edit box and expand it to edit the environment variables.

    ![Edit configuration screen](../_static/images/pycharm/remote-pycharm-edit_configurations_screen.png)

3. Add the environment variables and values of `MLRUN_DBPATH`, `MLRUN_ARTIFACT_PATH`, `V3IO_USERNAME`, `V3IO_API`, and `V3IO_ACCESS_KEY`.

## Remote Environment from VSCode

### Create Environment File

Create an environment file called `mlrun.env` in your workspace folder. Copy-paste the configuration below; replace the `<...>` placeholders to identify your remote target:

``` ini
# Remote URL to mlrun service
MLRUN_DBPATH=<API endpoint of the MLRun APIs service engpoint; e.g., "https://mlrun-api.default-tenant.app.mycluster.iguazio.com">
# Root artifact path on the remote server
MLRUN_ARTIFACT_PATH=<remote path; e.g., "/User/artifacts/{{run.project}">
# Iguazio platform username
V3IO_USERNAME=<username of a platform user with access to the MLRun service>
# V3IO data access API URL (copy from the services screen)
V3IO_API=<API endpoint of the webapi service endpoint; e.g., "https://default-tenant.app.mycluster.iguazio.com:8444">
# Iguazio V3IO data layer credentials (copy from your user settings)
V3IO_ACCESS_KEY=<platform access key>
```

> **Note**: Make sure that you add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file. The environment file contains sensitive information that you should not store in your source control.

### Create Python Debug Configuration

Create a [debug configuration in VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging). Configurations are defined in a `launch.json` file that's stored in a `.vscode` folder in your workspace.

To initialize debug configurations, first select the Run view in the sidebar:

![Run icon](../_static/images/vscode/debug-icon.png)

If you don't yet have any configurations defined, you'll see a button to Run and Debug, as well as a link to create a configuration (launch.json) file:

![Debug toolbar settings command](../_static/images/vscode/debug-start.png)

To generate a `launch.json` file with Python configurations, do the following steps:

1. Click the **create a launch.json file** link (circled in the image above) or use the **Run** > **Open configurations** menu command.

2. A configuration menu will open from the Command Palette allowing you to choose the type of debug configuration you want for the opened file. For now, in the **Select a debug configuration** menu that appears, select **Python File**.
![Debug configurations menu](../_static/images/vscode/debug-configurations.png)

   > **Note** Starting a debugging session through the Debug Panel, **F5** or **Run > Start Debugging**, when no configuration exists will also bring up the debug configuration menu, but will not create a launch.json file.

3. The Python extension then creates and opens a `launch.json` file that contains a pre-defined configuration based on what you previously selected, in this case **Python File**. You can modify configurations (to add arguments, for example), and also add custom configurations.

   ![Configuration json](../_static/images/vscode/configuration-json.png)

### Set Environment File in Debug Configuration

Add an `envFile` setting to your configuration with the value of `${workspaceFolder}/mlrun.env`

If you created a new configuration in the previous step, your `launch.json` would look as follows:

```javascript
{
    // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
    // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
    // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Python: Current File",
            "type": "python",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${file}",
            "console": "integratedTerminal",
            "envFile": "${workspaceFolder}/mlrun.env"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Set Environment Variables in a Terminal

You can create a script that sets the desired environment variables before launching your IDE

Create a file `mlrun_env.sh`, and copy-paste the code below; replace the `<...>` placeholders to identify your remote target:

``` bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Remote URL to mlrun service
export MLRUN_DBPATH=<API endpoint of the MLRun APIs service engpoint; e.g., "https://mlrun-api.default-tenant.app.mycluster.iguazio.com">
# Root artifact path on the remote server
export MLRUN_ARTIFACT_PATH=<remote path; e.g., "/User/artifacts/{{run.project}">
# Iguazio platform username
export V3IO_USERNAME=<username of a platform user with access to the MLRun service>
# V3IO data access API URL (copy from the services screen)
export V3IO_API=<API endpoint of the webapi service endpoint; e.g., "https://default-tenant.app.mycluster.iguazio.com:8444">
# Iguazio V3IO data layer credentials (copy from your user settings)
export V3IO_ACCESS_KEY=<platform access key>
```

In your terminal session execute:

```sh
source mlrun_env.sh
```

Then launch your IDE from the same terminal session.
