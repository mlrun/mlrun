    "# View model monitoring results in Grafana\n",
    "\n",
    "You can deploy a Grafana service in your Iguazio instance and use Grafana Dashboards to view model monitoring details.\n",
    "There are four dashboards:\n",
    "* [Overview dashboard](#model-endpoints-overview-dashboard)\n",
    "* [Details dashboard](#model-monitoring-details-dashboard)\n",
    "* [Performance dashboard](#model-monitoring-performance-dashboard)\n",
    "* [Applications dashboard](#model-monitoring-applications-dashboard)\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "You need to train and deploy a model to see results in the dashboards.\n",
    "The dashboards immediately display data if you already have a model that is trained and running with production data.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model monitoring Overview dashboard\n",
    "The Overview dashboard displays the model endpoint IDs of a specific project. Only deployed models with Model Monitoring enabled are displayed.\n",
    "Endpoint IDs are URIs used to provide access to performance data and drift detection statistics of a deployed model.\n",
    "\n",
    "![overview](../_static/images/overview.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Overview pane provides details about the performance of all the deployed and monitored models within a project. You can change projects by choosing a new project from the\n",
    "**Project** dropdown. The Overview dashboard displays the number of endpoints in the project, the average predictions per second (using a 5-minute rolling average),\n",
    "the average latency (using a 1-hour rolling average), and the total error count in the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional details include:\n",
    "* **Endpoint ID** &mdash; the ID of the deployed model. Use this link to drill down to the model performance and details panes.\n",
    "* **Function** &mdash; the MLRun function to access the model\n",
    "* **Model** &mdash; user defined name for the model\n",
    "* **Model Class** &mdash; the implementation class that is used by the endpoint\n",
    "* **First Request** &mdash; first request for production data\n",
    "* **Last Request** &mdash; most recent request for production data\n",
    "* **Error Count** &mdash; includes prediction process errors such as operational issues (for example, a function in a failed state), as well as data processing errors (for example, invalid timestamps, request ids, type mismatches etc.)\n",
    "* **Drift Status** &mdash; no drift (green), possible drift (yellow), drift detected (red)\n",
    "\n",
    "At the bottom of the dashboard are heat maps for the Predictions per second (5 minute average), Average Latency (one hour average), and Errors.\n",
    "See [How to Read a Heat Map](#how-to-read-a-heat-map) for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Click an endpoint ID to drill down to the performance details of that model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to read a heat map\n",
    "Heat maps are used to analyze trends and to instantly transform and enhance data through visualizations. This helps to quickly identify areas of interest,\n",
    "and empower users to explore the data in order to pinpoint where there may be potential issues. A heat map uses a matrix layout with colour and shading to show the relationship between\n",
    "two categories of values (x and y axes), so the darker the cell, the higher the value. The values presented along each axis correspond to a cell which is color-coded to represent the relationship between\n",
    "the two categories. The Predictions per second heatmap shows the relationship between time, and the predictions per second, and the Average Latency per hour shows the relationship between\n",
    "time and the latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "To properly read the heap maps, follow the hierarchy of shades from the darkest (the highest values) to the lightest shades (the lowest values).\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "The exact quantitative values represented by the colors may be difficult to determine. Use the [Performance Dashboard](#model-endpoint-performance-dashboard) to see detailed results.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model monitoring Details dashboard\n",
    "The model monitoring details dashboard displays the real-time performance data of the selected model in detail.\n",
    "Model performance data provided is rich and is used to fine tune or diagnose potential performance issues that may affect business goals.\n",
    "The data in this dashboard changes based on the selection of the project and model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dashboard panes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Project and model summary](#project-and-model-summary)\n",
    "- [Overall drift analysis](#overall-drift-analysis)\n",
    "- [Incoming features graph](#incoming-features-graph)\n",
    "\n",
    "![details](../_static/images/details.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project and model summary\n",
    "Use the dropdown to change the project and model. Results are based on the last run only. The dashboard presents the following information about the project:\n",
    "* **Endpoint ID** &mdash; the ID of the deployed model\n",
    "* **Model** &mdash; user defined name for the model\n",
    "* **Function URI** &mdash; the MLRun function to access the model\n",
    "* **Model Class** &mdash; the implementation class that is used by the endpoint\n",
    "* **Prediction/s** &mdash; the average number of predictions per second over a rolling 5-minute period\n",
    "* **Average Latency** &mdash; the average latency over a rolling 1-hour period\n",
    "* **First Request** &mdash; first request for production data\n",
    "* **Last Request** &mdash; most recent request for production data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall Drift Analysis\n",
    "This pane has two sections: Overall Drift Analysis and Features Analysis. Results are based on the last run only. \n",
    "The Overall Drift Analysis pane provides performance statistics for the currently selected model.\n",
    "* **TVD** (sum and mean)\n",
    "* **Hellinger** (sum and mean)\n",
    "* **KLD** (sum and mean)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Incoming features graph\n",
    "This graph displays the performance of the features that are in the selected model based on sampled data points from actual feature production data.\n",
    "The graph displays the values of the features in the model over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model monitoring Performance dashboard\n",
    "Model endpoint performance displays performance details in graphical format.\n",
    "\n",
    "![performance](../_static/images/performance.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This dashboard has five graphs:\n",
    "* **Drift Measures** &mdash; the overall drift over time for each of the endpoints in the selected model\n",
    "* **Average Latency** &mdash; the average latency of the model in 5 minute intervals, for 5 minutes and 1 hour rolling windows\n",
    "* **Predictions/s**  &mdash; the model predictions per second displayed in 5 second intervals for 5 minutes (rolling)\n",
    "* **Predictions Count** &mdash; the number of predictions the model makes for 5 minutes and 1 hour rolling windows\n",
    "* **Custom Metrics** &mdash; user-defined custom metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model monitoring Applications dashboard\n",
    "Model monitoring of deployed applications displays drift details in graphical format.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Draft Status by Category** &mdash; the percentages of potential drift, no drift and detected drift\n",
    "* **Average Drift Value Result** &mdash; the average of the potential and the detected drift values\n",
    "* **Latest Result** &mdash; summary of the latest draft result \n",
    "* **Application Summary** &mdash; table summary of the application results including the schedule time, the metric \n",
    "name, metric kind, result status, and result numerical value. \n",
    "* **Result Value by Time** &mdash; user-defined metric by time. This value is calculated based on user defined function \n",
    "and represents a specific numerical result of the selected application by time.  \n",
    "* **Drift Detection History** &mdash; drift status by time. Using this chart you can detect different types of drifts by time such as gradual drift or incremental drift. To learn more about different types of drift, see [Concept Drift](https://www.iguazio.com/glossary/concept-drift/). Results that\n",
    "do not represent drift (\"irrelevant\") are filtered from this chart. \n",
