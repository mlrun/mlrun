# Using MLRun

MLRun is an open source AI orchestration platform for quickly building and managing continuous (gen) AI applications across their lifecycle. MLRun integrates into your development and CI/CD environment and automates the delivery of production data, ML pipelines, and online applications. MLRun significantly reduces engineering efforts, time to production, and computation resources.
With MLRun, you can choose any IDE on your local machine or on the cloud. MLRun breaks the silos between data, ML, software, and DevOps/MLOps teams, enabling collaboration and fast continuous improvements.

Get started with the MLRun **{ref}`Tutorials and examples <tutorials-all>`** and **{ref}`Installation and setup guide <install-setup-guide>`**.


This page explains how MLRun addresses the [**gen AI tasks**](#genai-tasks), [**MLOps tasks**](#mlops-tasks), and presents the [**MLRun core components**](#core-components).

See the supported data stores, development tools, services, platforms, etc., supported by MLRun's open architecture in **{ref}`ecosystem`**.

Use MLRun to develop, scale, deploy, and monitor your AI model scross your enterprise. 
[**Gen AI development workflow**](./genai/genai-flow.html) describes the different tasks and stages in detail. 

### Data management


MLRun supports batch or realtime data processing at scale, data lineage and versioning, structured and unstructured data, and more. 
Removing inappropriate data at an early stage saves resources that would otherwise be required later on.

### Development
Use MLRun to build an automated ML pipeline to: collect data, 
preprocess (prepare) the data, run the training pipeline, and evaluate the model.

### Deployment
MLRun serving can productize the newly trained LLM as a serverless function using real-time auto-scaling Nuclio serverless functions. 
The application pipeline includes all the steps from accepting events or data, contextualizing it with a state  preparing the required model features, 
inferring results using one or more models, and driving actions.

### Live Ops
Monitor all resources, data, model and application metrics to ensure performance. Then identify risks, control costs, and measure business KPIs.
Collect production data, metadata, and metrics to tune the model and application further, and to enable governance and explainability.

The [**MLOps development workflow**](./mlops-dev-flow.html) section describes the different tasks and stages in detail.
MLRun can be used to automate and orchestrate all the different tasks or just specific tasks (and integrate them with what you have already deployed).

### Project management and CI/CD automation

In MLRun the assets, metadata, and services (data, functions, jobs, artifacts, models, secrets, etc.) are organized into projects.
Projects can be imported/exported as a whole, mapped to git repositories or IDE projects (in PyCharm, VSCode, etc.), which enables versioning, collaboration, and CI/CD. 
Project access can be restricted to a set of users and roles.

### Ingest and process data

MLRun provides abstract interfaces to various offline and online [**data sources**](./store/datastore.html), supports batch or realtime data processing at scale, data lineage and versioning, structured and unstructured data, and more. 
In addition, the MLRun [**Feature store**](./feature-store/feature-store.html) automates the collection, transformation, storage, catalog, serving, and monitoring of data features across the ML lifecycle and enables feature reuse and sharing.

### Develop and train models

MLRun allows you to easily build ML pipelines that take data from various sources or the Feature Store and process it, 
train models at scale with multiple parameters, test models, track each experiment, and register, version and deploy 
models, etc. MLRun provides scalable built-in or custom model training services that integrate with any framework and 
can work with 3rd party training/auto-ML services. You can also bring your own pre-trained model and use it in the pipeline.

### Deploy models and applications


MLRun rapidly deploys and manages production-grade real-time or batch application pipelines using elastic and resilient serverless functions. MLRun addresses the entire ML application: intercepting application/user requests, running data processing tasks, inferencing using one or more models, driving actions, and integrating with the application logic.

### Monitor and alert

Observability is built into the different MLRun objects (data, functions, jobs, models, pipelines, etc.), eliminating the need for complex integrations and code instrumentation. With MLRun, you can observe the application/model resource usage and model behavior (drift, performance, etc.), define custom app metrics, and trigger alerts or retraining jobs.
