    "MLRun Project is a container for all your work on a particular activity. All the associated code, functions, \n",
    "jobs/workflows and artifacts. Projects can be mapped to `git` repositories which enable versioning, collaboration, and CI/CD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can create project definitions using the SDK or a yaml file and store those in MLRun DB, file, or archive.\n",
    "Once the project is loaded you can run jobs/workflows which refer to any project element by name, allowing separation between configuration and code. See the [Projects, Automation & CI/CD](../projects/overview.md) section for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Projects contain `workflows` which execute the registered functions in a sequence/graph (DAG), can reference project parameters, secrets and artifacts by name. MLRun currently supports two workflow engines, `local` (for simple tasks) and [Kubeflow Pipelines](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/pipelines/pipelines-quickstart/) (for more complex/advanced tasks), MLRun also supports a real-time workflow engine (see: [MLRun serving graphs](../serving/serving-graph.md)). \n",

    "- **`name`** (Required) &mdash; the project name.\n",
    "- **`context`** &mdash; the path to a local project directory (the project's context directory).\n",
    "  The project directory contains a project-configuration file (default: **project.yaml**), which defines the project, and additional generated Python code.\n",
    "  The project file is created when you save your project (using the `save` MLRun project method or when saving your first function within the project).\n",
    "- **`init_git`** &mdash; set to `True` to perform Git initialization of the project directory (`context`) in case its not initialized.\n",
    "  > **Note:** It's customary to store project code and definitions in a Git repository.\n",
