# Projects and automation

MLRun **Project** is a container for all your work on a particular ML application. Projects host [functions](../runtimes/functions.html), [workflows](../concepts/workflow-overview.html), [artifacts (datasets, models, etc.)](../store/artifacts.html), [features (sets, vectors)](../feature-store/feature-store.html), and configuration (parameters, [secrets](../secrets.html)
, source, etc.). Projects have owners and members with role-based access control.

Projects are stored in a GIT or archive and map to IDE projects (in PyCharm, VSCode, etc.), which enables versioning, collaboration, and [CI/CD](../projects/ci-integration.html). 
Projects simplify how you process data, [submit jobs](../concepts/submitting-tasks-jobs-to-functions.html), run [multi-stage workflows](../concepts/workflow-overview.html), and deploy [real-time pipelines](../serving/serving-graph.html) in continious development or production environments.
