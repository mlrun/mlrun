        Initialize a new TSDB connector. The connector is used to interact with the TSDB and store monitoring data.

        - real time performance metrics: real time performance metrics that are being calculated by the model
        monitoring stream pod.
        Among these metrics are the base metrics (average latency and predictions over time), endpoint features
        (data samples), and custom metrics (user-defined metrics).
        - app_results: a detailed results that include status, kind, extra data, etc. These results are being calculated
        through the monitoring applications and stored in the TSDB using the model monitoring writer.
        - metrics: a basic key value that represents a numeric metric. Similar to the app_results, these metrics
        are being calculated through the monitoring applications and stored in the TSDB using the model monitoring
        writer.
