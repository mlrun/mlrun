# In our docker images we're copying the requirements files and pip installing them before copying and installing the
# whole code. We're doing that to levarage docker build cache so that we won't need to actually install all of the
# requirements for every change in the code (which causes a cache miss in the copy command for the whole code) but we'll
# get "requirement is already satisified" which causes the pip install of the mlrun package itself to be very quick.
# The extras requirements definition sits in the setup.py itself, therefore without this file these requirements were
# installed only in the last phase of installing mlrun, which causes this step to be longer and lower the effectivness
# of the above trick. To overcome this we have this file, which is a copy of all the requirements defined in the extras
# in setup.py so that we'll be able to copy and install this in the layer with all other requirements making the last
# layer (which is most commonly being re-built) as thin as possible
# we have a test test_extras_requirement_file_aligned to verify this file is aligned to setup.py
