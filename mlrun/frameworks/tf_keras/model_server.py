                                         from it. If multiple objects needed to be imported from the same py file a list
                                         can be given. The map can be passed as a path to a json file as well. For
                                         example:

                                         meaning each py file will be read from 'custom_objects_directory/<MAP VALUE>'.
                                         If the model path given is of a store object, the custom objects map will be

                                         Notice: The custom objects will be imported in the order they came in this
                                         dictionary (or json). If a custom object is depended on another, make sure to
                                         put it below the one it relies on.
        :param custom_objects_directory: Path to the directory with all the python files required for the custom
                                         objects. Can be passed as a zip file as well (will be extracted during the run
                                         before loading the model). If the model path given is of a store object, the
