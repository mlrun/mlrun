# Model monitoring for Gen AI

Gen AI model monitoring focuses on tracking the performance of algorithms that generate new outputs based on the data they have been trained on. 
Model monitoring ensures high-quality and relevant generated content. See the {ref}`overall description of model monitoring <model-monitoring-overview>`.

Model monitoring for generative AI includes:
- Monitoring output quality &mdash; Ensuring that the generated content, such as text, images, video, or data, is of high quality and relevance.
- Coherence and consistency &mdash; Monitoring the coherence and consistency of the generated outputs to ensure they make sense and are contextually appropriate.
- Compliance and risk management &mdash; Ensuring that the generated content complies with regulatory requirements and does not pose any risks, especially in sensitive industries like finance and healthcare.
- Calibrating data combinations &mdash; Adjusting the combinations of data used to train the generative algorithms to produce lifelike and credible outputs.

## Multi-port predictions

Multi-port predictions involve generating multiple outputs or predictions at the same time from a single model or system. Each "port" can be thought of as a separate output channel 
that provides a distinct prediction or piece of information. For example, it can return an answer and a confidence level on the same port. 
This capability is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple related predictions are needed simultaneously. 
By making multiple predictions simultaneously, systems can operate more efficiently, reducing the time and computational resources required. 
And, multi-port predictions provide a more holistic view of the data, enabling better decision-making and more accurate forecasting

Multi-port predictions can be applied in several ways:
- Multi-task learning &mdash; A single model is trained to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, such as predicting different attributes of an object. For example, a model could predict both the age and gender of a person from a single image.
- Ensemble methods &mdash; Multiple models are combined to make predictions, and each model's output can be considered a separate port. The final prediction is often an aggregation of these individual outputs.
- Time series forecasting &mdash; In time series analysis, multi-port predictions can be used to forecast multiple future time points simultaneously, providing a more comprehensive view of future trends.

## Batch inputs

Batch inputs involve grouping multiple input sequences or data points together and processing them as a single batch. This method is commonly used in the training of 
generative AI models to enhance computational efficiency and model performance. 
By processing data in batches, the model can update its parameters based on the collective information from the entire batch, rather than processing each data point individually. 
Batch input enhances:
- Efficiency &mdash; Processing data in batches allows for parallel computation, significantly speeding up the training and inference processes. This is especially important for large-scale models that require substantial computational resources.
- Model performance &mdash; By learning from multiple data points simultaneously, the model can better capture patterns and relationships in the data, leading to improved performance and accuracy.
- Scalability &mdash; Batch processing enables the model to handle larger datasets and more complex tasks, making it more scalable and adaptable to different applications.

Batch inputs can be used in various stages and applications of gen AI:
- Training &mdash; By feeding multiple prompts or data points into the model simultaneously, the model learns from a diverse set of examples in each training iteration, improving its generalization capabilities.
- Inference &mdash; In the inference phase, batch inputs enable the model to generate multiple outputs at once, which is particularly useful for applications requiring high throughput, such as generating large volumes of text or images.
- Data preprocessing &mdash; Batch inputs are used in the preprocessing stage to prepare data for training, fow example, data cleansing, file format conversion, and handling sensitive data to ensure the quality and consistency of the input data.

You can pass a few strings in one batch.
Batch input that looks like: </br>
```[[1,2,3], [5,2,9]]```</br>
would give output like:</br>
```[11, 0.6], [0, 0.87]```

Batch input that looks like: </br>
```[[1,2,3, "jhk",], [5,2,9, "tsc"]]```</br>
would give output like:</br>
```[11, 8.6], [0, 0.87]```
