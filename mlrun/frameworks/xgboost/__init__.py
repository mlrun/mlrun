    Wrap the given model with MLRun's interface providing it with mlrun's additional features.

    :param model:                    The model to wrap. Can be loaded from the model path given as well.
    :param model_name:               The model name to use for storing the model artifact. Default: "model".
    :param tag:                      The model's tag to log with.
    :param model_path:               The model's store object path. Mandatory for evaluation (to know which model to
                                     update). If model is not provided, it will be loaded from this path.
    :param modules_map:              A dictionary of all the modules required for loading the model. Each key is a
                                     path to a module and its value is the object name to import from it. All the
                                     modules will be imported globally. If multiple objects needed to be imported
                                     from the same module a list can be given. The map can be passed as a path to a
                                     json file as well. For example:

                                     .. code-block:: python

                                         {
                                             "module1": None,  # import module1
                                             "module2": ["func1", "func2"],  # from module2 import func1, func2
                                             "module3.sub_module": "func3",  # from module3.sub_module import func3
                                         }

                                     If the model path given is of a store object, the modules map will be read from
                                     the logged modules map artifact of the model.
    :param custom_objects_map:       A dictionary of all the custom objects required for loading the model. Each key is
                                     a path to a python file and its value is the custom object name to import from it.
                                     If multiple objects needed to be imported from the same py file a list can be
                                     given. The map can be passed as a path to a json file as well. For example:

                                     .. code-block:: python

                                         {
                                             "/.../custom_model.py": "MyModel",
                                             "/.../custom_objects.py": ["object1", "object2"]
                                         }

                                     All the paths will be accessed from the given 'custom_objects_directory', meaning
                                     each py file will be read from 'custom_objects_directory/<MAP VALUE>'. If the model
                                     path given is of a store object, the custom objects map will be read from the
                                     logged custom object map artifact of the model.
                                     Notice: The custom objects will be imported in the order they came in this
                                     dictionary (or json). If a custom object is depended on another, make sure to
                                     put it below the one it relies on.
    :param custom_objects_directory: Path to the directory with all the python files required for the custom objects.
                                     Can be passed as a zip file as well (will be extracted during the run before
                                     loading the model). If the model path given is of a store object, the custom
                                     objects files will be read from the logged custom object artifact of the model.
    :param context:                  MLRun context to work with. If no context is given it will be retrieved via
                                     'mlrun.get_or_create_ctx(None)'
    :param artifacts:                A list of artifacts plans to produce during the run.
    :param metrics:                  A list of metrics to calculate during the run.
    :param x_test:                   The validation data for producing and calculating artifacts and metrics post
                                     training. Without this, validation will not be performed.
    :param y_test:                   The test data ground truth for producing and calculating artifacts and metrics post
                                     training or post predict / predict_proba.
    :param sample_set:               A sample set of inputs for the model for logging its stats along the model in
                                     favour of model monitoring.
    :param y_columns:                List of names of all the columns in the ground truth labels in case its a
                                     pd.DataFrame or a list of integers in case the dataset is a np.ndarray. If not
                                     given but 'y_train' / 'y_test' is given then the labels / indices in it will be
                                     used by default.
    :param feature_vector:           Feature store feature vector uri (store://feature-vectors/<project>/<name>[:tag])
    :param feature_weights:          List of feature weights, one per input column.
    :param labels:                   Labels to log with the model.
    :param parameters:               Parameters to log with the model.
    :param extra_data:               Extra data to log with the model.
    :param auto_log:                 Whether to apply MLRun's auto logging on the model. Auto logging will add the
                                     default artifacts and metrics to the lists of artifacts and metrics. Default:
                                     True.
