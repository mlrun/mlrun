# Distributed Functions

Many of the runtimes support horizontal scaling. You can specify the number of `replicas` or the 
min&mdash;max value range (for auto scaling in Dask or Nuclio). When scaling functions MLRun uses a high-speed
messaging protocol and shared storage (volumes, objects, databases, or streams). MLRun runtimes
handle the orchestration and monitoring of the distributed task.
