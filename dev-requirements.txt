# See jupyter-server requirement in nuclio-jupyter (https://github.com/nuclio/nuclio-jupyter/blob/master/Pipfile#L19)
# for why we're limiting it to a specific version and the relation to tornado
# The jupyter-server that we're using (1.0.8) has a bug (https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server/issues/337)
# which makes pytest dependent on pytest-tornasync (when jupyter-server is installed) the bug was fixed
# (https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server/pull/339) and released in 1.1.0
# (https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server/releases/tag/1.1.0) But the change there require tornado upgrade
# which we can't make currently
# TODO: when tornado upgrade is possible, upgrade jupyter-server and remove this
