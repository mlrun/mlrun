    "applications with `SparkApplication` and cron-scheduled applications with `ScheduledSparkApplication`. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "When sending a request with MLRun to the Spark operator, the request contains your full application configuration including the \n",
    "code and dependencies to run (packaged as a docker image or specified via URIs), the infrastructure parameters, (e.g. the \n",
    "memory, CPU, and storage volume specs to allocate to each Spark executor), and the Spark configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kubernetes takes this request and starts the Spark driver in a Kubernetes pod (a k8s abstraction, just a docker container \n",
    "in this case). The Spark driver then communicates directly with the Kubernetes master to request executor pods, scaling them \n",
    "up and down at runtime according to the load if dynamic allocation is enabled. Kubernetes takes care of the bin-packing of \n",
    "the pods onto Kubernetes nodes (the physical VMs), and dynamically scales the various node pools to meet the requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using Spark operator the resources are allocated per task, meaning that it scales down to zero when the task is done.\n"
