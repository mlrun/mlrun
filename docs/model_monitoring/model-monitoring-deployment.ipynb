    "Model Monitoring is based on Iguazio's streaming technology. Contact Iguazio to enable this feature.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "MLRun provides a model monitoring service that tracks the performance of models in production to help identify\n",
    "potential issues with concept drift and prediction accuracy before they impact business goals.\n",
    "Typically, Model monitoring is used by devops for tracking model performance and by data scientists to track model drift.\n",
    "Two monitoring types are supported:\n",
    "1. Model operational performance (latency, requests per second, etc..)\n",
    "2. Drift detection - identifies potential issues with the model. See [Drift Analysis](#drift-analysis) for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Monitoring provides warning alerts that can be sent to stakeholders for processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Model Monitoring data can be viewed using Iguazio's user interface or through Grafana Dashboards. Grafana is an interactive web application, visualization tool\n",
    "that can be added as a service in the Iguazio platform. See [Model Monitoring Using Grafana Dashboards](#model-monitoring-using-grafana-dashboards) for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture\n",
    "The Model Monitoring process flow starts with collecting operational data. The operational data are converted to vectors which are posted to the Model Server.\n",
    "The Model Server is then wrapped around a machine learning model that uses a function to calculate predictions based on the available vectors.\n",
    "Next, the Model Server creates a log for the input and output of the vectors, and the entries are written to the production data stream (a [v3io stream](#https://nuclio.io/docs/latest/reference/triggers/v3iostream/)).\n",
    "While the Model Server is processing the vectors, a Nuclio operation monitors the log of the data stream and is triggered when a new log entry is detected.\n",
    "The Nuclio function examines the log entry, processes it into statistics which are then written to the statistics databases (parquet file, time series database and key value database).\n",
    "The parquet files are written as a feature set under the model monitoring project. The parquet files can be read either using `pandas.read_parquet` or `feature_set.get_offline_features`, like any other feature set.\n",
    "In parallel, a scheduled MLRun job runs reading the parquet files, performing drift analysis. The drift analysis data is stored so that the user can retrieve it in the Iguazio UI or in a Grafana dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Architecture](./model-monitoring-data-flow.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Drift Analysis\n",
    "The Model Monitoring feature provides drift analysis monitoring.\n",
    "Model Drift in machine learning is a situation where the statistical properties of the target variable (what the model is trying to predict) change over time.\n",
    "In other words, the production data has changed significantly over the course of time and no longer matches the input data used to train the model.\n",
    "So, for this new data, accuracy of the model predictions is low. Drfit analysis statistics are computed once an hour.\n",
    "For more information see <a href=\"https://www.iguazio.com/glossary/concept-drift/\" target=\"_blank\">Concept Drift</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Terminology\n",
    "The following are terms you will see in all the model monitoring screens:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Total Variation Distance** (TVD)&mdash;this is the statistical difference between the actual predictions, and the model's trained predictions\n",
    "* **Hellinger Distance**&mdash;this is a type of f-divergence that quantifies the similarity between the actual predictions, and the model's trained predictions.\n",
    "* **Kullback–Leibler Divergence** (KLD)&mdash;this is the measure of how the probability distribution of actual predictions is different from the second, model's trained reference probability distribution.\n",
    "* **Model Endpoint**&mdash; a combination of a deployed nuclio function and the models themselves. One function can run multiple endpoints; however, statistics are saved per endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Monitoring Using the Iguazio Platform Interface\n",
    "Iguazio's Model Monitoring data is available for viewing through the regular platform interface.\n",
    "The platform provides four information screens with model monitoring data.\n",

    "#### How to Read a Heat Map\n",
    "Heat maps are used to analyze trends and to instantly transform and enhance data through visualizations. This helps identify areas of interest quickly,\n",
    "and empower users to explore the data in order to pinpoint where there may be potential issues. A heat map uses a matrix layout with colour and shading to show the relationship between\n",
    "two categories of values (x and y axes), so the darker the cell, the higher the value. The values presented along each axis correspond to a cell which is then colour-coded to represent the relationship between\n",
    "the two categories. The Predictions per second heatmap shows the relationship between time, and the predictions per second, and the Average Latency per hour shows the relationship between\n",
    "time and the latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "To properly read the heap maps, look follow the hierarchy of shades from the darkest (the highest values) to the lightest shades (the lowest values).\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "The exact quantitative values represented by the colors may be difficult to determine. Use the [Performance Dashboard](#model-endpoint-performance-dashboard) to see detailed results.\n",
