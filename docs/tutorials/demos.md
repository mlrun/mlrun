# Demos

These end-to-end demos demonstrate how to use the Iguazio AI platform, MLRun, and related tools, to address data science requirements for different industries and implementations.

```{admonition} For Iguazio AI Platform users
For the demos that are in the [MLRun demos repository](https://github.com/mlrun/demos), use the provided 
[update demos script](https://github.com/mlrun/demos/blob/v1.6.x/update_demos.sh)
to get the updated demos from this repository.
By default, the script retrieves the files from the latest release that matches the version of the installed `mlrun` package.
The files are copied to the **/v3io/users/&lt;username&gt;/demos** directory, where `<username>` is the name of the running user (`$V3IO_USERNAME`) unless you set the `-u|--user` flag to another username.
Before running the script, close any open files in the **demos** directory.

To get additional demos, run: ```!/User/demos/update-demos.sh```
For full usage instructions, run the script with the `-h` or `--help` flag: ```!/User/demos/update-demos.sh --help```
```


## Gen AI Demos

|Demo|Description|
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|<b>[Call center demo](https://github.com/mlrun/demo-call-center)</b>|This demo showcases how to use LLMs to turn audio files, from call center conversations between customers and agents, into valuable data &mdash; all in a single workflow orchestrated by MLRun. MLRun automates the entire workflow, auto-scales resources as needed, and automatically logs and ses values between the different workflow steps.|
|<b>[Fine tune an LLM and build a BOT](https://github.com/mlrun/demo-llm-tuning/blob/main)</b>|This demo shows how to fine-tune an LLM and build a chatbot that can answer all your questions about MLRun's MLOps. It starts with a pre-trained model from Hugging Face, fine tunes the model, creates an automated training pipeline, and deploys a serving graph. The serving graph includes post-processing for accuracy of generated text, and filtering for toxicity.|
|<b>[Interactive bot demo using LLMs](https://github.com/mlrun/demo-llm-bot/blob/main/README.md)</b>|This demo showcases the usage of Language Models (LLMs) and MLRun to build an interactive chatbot using your own data for Retrieval Augmented Question Answering. The data will be ingested and indexed into a Vector Database to be queried by an LLM in real-time. The project utilizes MLRun for orchestration/deployment, HuggingFace embeddings for indexing data, Milvus for the vector database, OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model for generating responses, Langchain to retrieve relevant data from the vector store and augment the response from the LLM, and Gradio for building an interactive frontend.|


## ML Demos

|Demo|Description|
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|<b>[Mask Detection Demo](https://github.com/mlrun/demo-mask-detection)</b>|This demo contains three notebooks that: Serve the model as a serverless function in an http endpoint; Train and evaluate a model for detecting if an image includes a person who is wearing a mask, by using Tensorflow, Keras, or PyTorch; Write an automatic pipeline where you download a dataset of images, train and evaluate the model, then optimize the model (using ONNX) and serve it.|
|<b>[Fraud Prevention (Feature Store)](https://github.com/mlrun/demo-fraud)</b>|This demo shows the usage of MLRun and the feature store. Fraud prevention specifically is a challenge as it requires processing raw transaction and events in real-time and being able to quickly respond and block transactions before they occur. Consider, for example, a case where you would like to evaluate the average transaction amount. When training the model, it is common to take a DataFrame and just calculate the average. However, when dealing with real-time/online scenarios, this average has to be calculated incrementally.|
|<b>[News Article Summarization and Keyword Extraction via NLP](https://github.com/mlrun/demos/tree/master/news-article-nlp)</b>|This demo creates an NLP pipeline that summarizes and extract keywords from a news article URL. It uses state-of-the-art transformer models, such as BERT, to perform these NLP tasks. Additionally, it uses real-time inference graphs to create the pipeline. This allows for easy containerization and deployment of the pipeline on top of a production-ready Kubernetes cluster.|
|<b>[Predictive Network Operations/Telemetry](https://github.com/mlrun/demos/tree/master/network-operations)</b>|This demo demonstrates how to build an automated machine-learning (ML) pipeline for predicting network outages based on network-device telemetry, also known as Network Operations (NetOps). The demo implements feature engineering, model training, testing, inference, and model monitoring (with concept-drift detection). The demo uses an offline/real-time metrics simulator to generate semi-random network telemetry data that is used across the pipeline. |        </td>
|<b>[Stocks Prices Prediction Demo](https://github.com/mlrun/demos/tree/master/stocks-prediction)</b>|This the demo predicts stocks price base on two data sets: the stock daily price and the news. it trains the model and generates predictions using model serving, feature store, MLRun frameworks.|
|<b>[Sagemaker demo](https://github.com/mlrun/demo-sagemaker)</b>|This demo showcases how to build, manage, and deploy ML models using AWS SageMaker and MLRun. It emphasizes the automation of ML workflows from development to production.|
|<b>[Converting existing ML code to an MLRun project](https://github.com/mlrun/demos/tree/1.6.x/howto/converting-to-mlrun)</b>|Demonstrates how to convert existing ML code to an MLRun project. The demo implements an MLRun project for taxi ride-fare prediction based on a [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jsylas/python-version-of-top-ten-rank-r-22-m-2-88) with an ML Python script that uses data from the [New York City Taxi Fare Prediction competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction).|
|<b>[Running a Spark job for reading a CSV file](https://github.com/mlrun/demos/blob/1.6.x/howto/spark/spark-mlrun-read-csv.ipynb)</b>|Demnstrates how to run a Spark job that reads a CSV file and logs the data set to an MLRun database.|
|<b>[Running a Spark job for analyzing data](https://github.com/mlrun/demos/blob/1.6.x/howto/spark/spark-mlrun-describe.ipynb)</b>|Demonstrates how to create and run a Spark job that generates a profile report from an Apache Spark DataFrame based on pandas profiling.|
|<b>[Running a Spark Job with Spark Operator](https://github.com/mlrun/demos/blob/1.6.x/howto/spark/spark-operator.ipynb)</b>|Demonstrates how to use [Spark Operator](https://github.com/kubeflow/spark-operator) to run a Spark job over Kubernetes with MLRun.|
