MLRun Package Documentation
============================

*The Open-Source MLOps Orchestration Framework*

MLRun is an open-source MLOps framework that offers an integrative approach to managing your machine-learning pipelines from early development through model development to full pipeline deployment in production.
MLRun offers a convenient abstraction layer to a wide variety of technology stacks while empowering data engineers and data scientists to define the feature and models.

The MLRun Architecture
************************

    :alt: MLRun architecture

MLRun is composed of the following layers:

- **Feature and Artifact Store**  
    Handles the ingestion, processing, metadata, and storage of data and features across multiple repositories and technologies.
- **Elastic Serverless Runtimes**
    Converts simple code to scalable and managed microservices with workload-specific runtime engines (such as Kubernetes jobs, Nuclio, Dask, Spark, and Horovod).
- **ML Pipeline Automation**
    Automates data preparation, model training and testing, deployment of real-time production pipelines, and end-to-end monitoring.
- **Central Management**
    Provides a unified portal for managing the entire MLOps workflow.
    The portal includes a UI, a CLI, and an SDK, which are accessible from anywhere.

Key Benefits
************************

MLRun provides the following key benefits:

- **Rapid deployment** of code to production pipelines
- **Elastic scaling** of batch and real-time workloads
- **Feature management** – ingestion, preparation, and monitoring
- **Works anywhere** – your local IDE, multi-cloud, or on-prem
