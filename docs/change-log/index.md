###  Documentation
New sections describing [Git best practices](../projects/git-best-practices.html) and an example [Nuclio function](../concepts/nuclio-real-time-functions.html#example-of-nuclio-function).

## v1.3.0

### Client/server matrix, prerequisites, and installing

The MLRun server is now based on Python 3.9. It's recommended to move the client to Python 3.9 as well. 

MLRun v1.3.0 maintains support for mlrun base images that are based on python 3.7. To differentiate between the images, the images based on
python 3.7 have the suffix: `-py37`. The correct version is automatically chosen for the built-in MLRun images according to the Python version of the MLRun client (for example, a 3.7 Jupyter gets the `-py37` images).

MLRun is pre-installed in CE Jupyter.

To install on a **Python 3.9** environment, run:<br>
```
./align_mlrun.sh
```

To install on a **Python 3.7** environment (and optionally upgrade to python 3.9), run:
  
1. Configure the Jupyter service with the env variable `JUPYTER_PREFER_ENV_PATH=false`.
2. Within the Jupyter service, open a terminal and update conda and pip to have an up-to-date pip resolver.

```
$CONDA_HOME/bin/conda install -y conda=23.1.0
$CONDA_HOME/bin/conda install -y 'pip>=22.0'
```
3. If you wish to upgrade to python 3.9, create a new conda env and activate it:
```
conda create -n python39 python=3.9 ipykernel -y
conda activate python39
```
4. Install mlrun:
```
./align_mlrun.sh
```
    
### New and updated features

#### Feature store


| ID            | Description                                                    |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ML-2592 | Offline data can be registered as feature sets (Tech Preview). See [Create a feature set without ingesting its data](../feature-store/feature-sets.html#create-a-feature-set-without-ingesting-its-data). |
| ML-2610 | Supports SQLSource for batch ingestion (Tech Preview). See [SQL data source](../data-prep/ingest-data-fs.html#sql-data-source). |
| ML-2610 | Supports SQLTarget for storey engine (Tech Preview). (Spark is not yet supported.) See [SQL target store](../data-prep/ingest-data-fs.html#sql-target-store). |
| ML-2709 | The Spark engine now supports the steps: `MapValues`, `Imputer`, `OneHotEncoder`, `DropFeatures`; and supports extracting the time parts from the date in the `DateExtractor` step. See [Data transformations](../serving/available-steps.html#data-transformations). |
| ML-2802 | `get_offline_features` supports Spark Operator and Remote Spark. |
| ML-2957 | The username and password for the RedisNoSqlTarget are now configured using secrets, as `<prefix_>REDIS_USER <prefix_>REDIS_PASSWORD` where \<prefix> is the optional RedisNoSqlTarget `credentials_prefix` parameter. See [Redis target store](../data-prep/ingest-data-fs.html#redis-target-store). |
| ML-3008 | Supports Spark using Redis as an online KV target, which caused a [breaking change](#breaking-changes). |
| ML-3373 |  Supports creating a feature vector over several feature sets with different entities. (Outer joins are Tech Preview.) See [Using an offline feature vector](../feature-store/feature-vectors.html#using-an-offline-feature-vector). This API will change in a future release, moving the relationship from the feature set to the feature vector. |

#### Logging data
| ID   | Description                                                    |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ML-2845 | Logging data using `hints`. You can now pass data into MLRun and log it using log hints, instead of the decorator. This is the initial change in MLRun to simplify wrapping usable code into MLRun without having to modify it. Future releases will continue this paradigm shift. See [more details](../cheat-sheet.html#track-returning-values-using-hints-and-returns). |


#### Projects

| ID   | Description                                                    |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ML-3048 | When defining a new project from scratch, there is now a default `context` directory: \"`./`". This is the directory from which the MLRun client runs, unless otherwise specified. |   

#### Serving graphs

| ID   | Description                                                    |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ML-1167 | Add support for graphs that split and merge (DAG), including a list of steps for the `after` argument in the `add_step()` method. See [Graph that splits and rejoins](../serving/model-serving-get-started.html#graph-that-splits-and-rejoins). |
| ML-2507 | Supports configuring of consumer group name for steps following QueueSteps. See [Queue (streaming)](../serving/model-serving-get-started.html#queue-streaming). |


#### Storey 

| ID   | Description                                                    |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ML-2502 | The event time in storey events is now taken from the `timestamp_key`. If the `timestamp_key` is not defined for the event, then the time is taken from the processing-time metadata. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/pull/2660), and in [Storey git](https://github.com/mlrun/storey/pull/394). |
 

#### UI 

| ID   | Description                                                    |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ML-1186 | The new **Projects** home page provides easy and intuitive access to the full project lifecycle in three phases, with links to the relevant wizards under each phase heading: ingesting and processing data, developing and training a model, deploying and monitoring the project. <p align="center"><img src="../_static/images/project-homepage.png" alt="mlrun-project-homepage" /></p><br> |
| NA | [UI change log in GitHub](https://github.com/mlrun/ui/releases/tag/v1.3.0) |


#### APIs 

| ID   | Description                                                    |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ML-3104 | These APIs now only return reasons in kwargs: `log_and_raise`, `generic_error_handler`, `http_status_error_handler`. |
| ML-3204 | New API `set_image_pull_configuration` that modifies `func.spec.image_pull_secret` and `func.spec.image_pull_policy`, instead of directly accessing these values through the spec. |
 
####  Documentation

Improvements to [Set up your environment](../install/remote.html).


#### Infrastructure improvements 

| ID   | Description                                                    |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ML-2609 |  MLRun server is based on Python 3.9. |
| ML-2732 | The new log collection service improves the performance and reduces heavy IO operations from the API container. The new MLRun log collector service is a gRPC server, which runs as sidecar in the mlrun-api pod (chief and worker). The service is responsible for collecting logs from run pods, writing to persisted files, and reading them on request. The new service is transparent to the end-user: there are no UI or API changes. |

### Breaking changes 


- The behavior of ingest with aggregation changed in v1.3.0 (storey, spark, pandas engines). Now, when you ingest a "timestamp" column, it returns <br>
`<class 'pandas._libs.tslibs.timestamps.Timestamp'>`. <br>Previously, it returned `<class 'str'>`
- Any target data that was saved using Redis as an online target with storey engine (RedisNoSql target, introduced in 1.2.1) is not accessible after upgrading to v1.3. (Data ingested subsequent to the upgrade is unaffacted.)

## v1.2.0

### New and updated features

#### Artifacts
- Support for artifact tagging:
   - SDK: Add `tag_artifacts`  and `delete_artifacts_tags` that can be used to modify existing artifacts tags and have 
    more than one version for an artifact.
    - UI: You can add and edit artifact tags in the UI.
    - API: Introduce new endpoints in `/projects/<project>/tags`.
    
#### Auth
- Support S3 profile and assume-role when using `fsspec`.
- Support GitHub fine grained tokens.

#### Documentation
- Restructured, and added new content.

#### Feature store
- Support Redis as an online feature set for storey engine only. (See [Redis target store](../data-prep/ingest-data-fs.html#redis-target-store).)
- Fully supports ingesting with pandas engine, now equivalent to ingestion with `storey` engine (TechPreview):
   - Support DataFrame with multi-index.
   - Support mlrun steps when using pandas engine: `OneHotEncoder` , `DateExtractor`, `MapValue`, `Imputer` and `FeatureValidation`.
- Add new step: `DropFeature` for pandas and storey engines. (TechPreview)
- Add param query for `get_offline_feature` for filtering the output.

#### Frameworks
- Add `HuggingFaceModelServer` to `mlrun.frameworks` at `mlrun.frameworks.huggingface` to serve `HuggingFace` models.

#### Functions
- Add `function.with_annotations({"framework":"tensorflow"})` to user-created functions.
- Add `overwrite_build_params` to `project.build_function()` so the user can choose whether or not to keep the 
build params that were used in previous function builds.
- `deploy_function` has a new option of mock deployment that allows running the function locally.

#### Installation
- New option to install `google-cloud` requirements using `mlrun[google-cloud]`:  when installing MLRun for integration 
with GCP clients, only compatible packages are installed.

#### Models
- The Labels in the **Models > Overview** tab can be edited.



#### Internal
- Refactor artifacts endpoints to follow the MLRun convention of `/projects/<project>/artifacts/...`. (The previous API will be deprecated in a future release.)
- Add `/api/_internal/memory-reports/` endpoints for memory related metrics to better understand the memory consumption of the API.
- Improve the HTTP retry mechanism.
- Support a new lightweight mechanism for KFP pods to pull the run state they triggered. Default behavior is legacy, 
which pulls the logs of the run to figure out the run state. 
The new behavior can be enabled using a feature flag configured in the API.

### Breaking changes

- Feature store: Ingestion using pandas now takes the dataframe and creates indices out of the entity column 
(and removes it as a column in this df). This could cause breakage for existing custom steps when using a pandas engine.

### Closed issues

- Support logging artifacts larger than 5GB to V3IO. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/issues/2455).
- Limit KFP to kfp~=1.8.0, <1.8.14 due to non-backwards changes done in 1.8.14 for ParallelFor, which isn’t compatible with the MLRun managed KFP server (1.8.1). [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/issues/2516).
- Add `artifact_path` enrichment from project `artifact_path`. Previously, the parameter wasn't applied to project runs when defining `project.artifact_path`. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/issues/2507).
- Align timeouts for requests that are getting re-routed from worker to chief (for projects/background related endpoints). [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/issues/2565).
- Fix legacy artifacts load when loading a project. Fixed corner cases when legacy artifacts were saved to yaml and loaded back into the system using `load_project()`. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/issues/2584).
- Fix artifact `latest` tag enrichment to happen also when user defined a specific tag. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/issues/2572).
- Fix zip source extraction during function build. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/issues/2588).
- Fix Docker compose deployment so Nuclio is configured properly with a platformConfig file that sets proper mounts and network 
configuration for Nuclio functions, meaning that they run in the same network as MLRun. 
[View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/issues/2601).
- Workaround for background tasks getting cancelled prematurely, due to the current FastAPI version that 
has a bug in the starlette package it uses. The bug caused the task to get cancelled if the client’s HTTP connection 
was closed before the task was done. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/issues/2618).
- Fix run fails after deploying function without defined image. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/pull/2530).
- Fix scheduled jobs failed on GKE with resource quota error. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/pull/2520).
- Can now delete a model via tag. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/pull/2433).
