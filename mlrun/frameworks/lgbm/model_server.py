                                         from it. If multiple objects needed to be imported from the same py file a list
                                         can be given. The map can be passed as a path to a json file as well. For
                                         example:
                                         {

                                         meaning each py file will be read from 'custom_objects_directory/<MAP VALUE>'.
                                         If the model path given is of a store object, the custom objects map will be
                                         read from the logged custom object map artifact of the model.
                                         Notice: The custom objects will be imported in the order they came in this
                                         dictionary (or json). If a custom object is depended on another, make sure to

                                         before loading the model). If the model path given is of a store object, the
