        Initialize the handler. The model can be set here so it won't require loading. Note you must provide at least

                                         path in the following format:
                                         'store://models/<PROJECT_NAME>/<MODEL_NAME>:<VERSION>'

                                         * If given a logged model (store model path) it will be read from the artifact.

                                         from it. If multiple objects needed to be imported from the same py file a list
                                         can be given. The map can be passed as a path to a json file as well. For

                                         meaning each py file will be read from 'custom_objects_directory/<MAP VALUE>'.

                                         Notice: The custom objects will be imported in the order they came in this
                                         dictionary (or json). If a custom object is depended on another, make sure to

                                         objects. Can be passed as a zip file as well (will be extracted during the run
                                         before loading the model). If the model path given is of a store object, the
