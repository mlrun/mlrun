    "## Introduction\n",
    "MLRun provides a model monitoring service that tracks the performance of models in production to help identify\n",
    "potential issues with concept drift and prediction accuracy before they impact business goals.\n",
    "Typically, Model monitoring is used by devops for tracking model performance, and by data scientists to track model drift.\n",
    "Two monitoring types are supported:\n",
    "1. Model operational performance (stream processing)\n",
    "2. Concept drift detection and accuracy monitoring (features/labels/predictions)&mdash;see [Drift Analysis](#drift-analysis) for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Monitoring provides warning alerts that can be sent to stakeholders for processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Model Monitoring data can be viewed using Iguazio's user interface portal or through Grafana Dashboards.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture\n",
    "The Model Monitoring process flow starts by collecting operational data, converts them to vectors which are then posted to the Model Server.\n",
    "Then, the Model Server is wrapped around a machine learning model that uses a function to calculate predictions based on the available vectors.\n",
    "Next, the Model Server creates a log for the input and output of the vectors, and the entries are written to the production data stream.\n",
    "While the Model Server is processing the vectors, a Nuclio operation monitors the log of the data stream and is triggered when a new log entry is detected.\n",
    "The Nuclio function examines the log entry, processes it in to statistics which are then written to the statistics databases.\n",
    "In parallel, a scheduled MLRun runs and reads the parquet files performing the drift analysis which is then stored so that\n",
    "the user can retrieve the analysis data in the Iguazio UI or in a Grafana dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Architecture](./model-monitoring-data-flow.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Drift Analysis\n",
    "The Model Monitoring feature provides both Concept Drift analysis and accuracy monitoring.\n",
    "Concept Drift in machine learning is a situation where the statistical properties of the target variable (what the model is trying to predict) change over time.\n",
    "In other words, the production data has changed significantly over the course of time and no longer matches the input data used to train the model.\n",
    "So, for this new data, accuracy of the model predictions is low.\n",
    "For more information see <a href=\"https://www.iguazio.com/glossary/concept-drift/\" target=\"_blank\">Concept Drift</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Terminology\n",
    "The following are terms you will see in all the model monitoring screens:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Total Variation Distance** (TVD)&mdash;this is the statistical difference between the actual predictions, and the model's trained predictions\n",
    "* **Hellinger Distance**&mdash;this is a type of f-divergence that quantifies the similarity between the actual predictions, and the model's trained predictions.\n",
    "* **Kullbackâ€“Leibler Divergence** (KLD)&mdash;this is the measure of how the probability distribution of actual predictions is different from the second, model's trained reference probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Monitoring Using the Iguazio Platform Interface\n",
    "Iguazio's Model Monitoring datas is available for viewing through the regular platform interface.\n",
    "The platform provides four screens in which information about the model monitoring is displayed.\n",
    "* [Model Endpoint Summary List](#model-endpoint-summary-list)\n",
    "* [Model Endpoint Overview](#model-endpoint-overview)\n",

    "the two categories. The Predictions per second heatmap shows the relationship between time and the predictions per second, and the Average Latency per hour shows the relationship between\n",
    "time and the latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "To properly read the heap maps, look follow the hierarchy of shades from the darkest (the highest values) to the lightest shades (the lowest values).\n",
    "\n",
