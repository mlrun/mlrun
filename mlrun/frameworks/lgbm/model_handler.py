        Initialize the handler. The model can be set here, so it won't require loading. Note you must provide at least

        :param custom_objects_map:       A dictionary of all the custom objects required for loading the model. Each key
                                         is a path to a python file and its value is the custom object name to import
                                         from it. If multiple objects needed to be imported from the same py file a list
                                         can be given. The map can be passed as a path to a json file as well. For

                                         Notice: The custom objects will be imported in the order they came in this
                                         dictionary (or json). If a custom object is depended on another, make sure to

        :param custom_objects_directory: Path to the directory with all the python files required for the custom
                                         objects. Can be passed as a zip file as well (will be extracted during the run
                                         before loading the model). If the model path given is of a store object, the
