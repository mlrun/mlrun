    "# Tutorial 1 - MLRun Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first tutorial you will learn the basics of working with the open source framework called MLRun. <br>\n",
    "The tutorial starts with some general overview and then takes you through the following steps: <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 1: Settings and basic configuration\n",
    "* Step 2: Create a basic function and run it locally\n",
    "* Step 3: Run the function on the cluster\n",
    "* Step 4: View functions in the UI\n",
    "* Step 5: Schedule functions\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that if are using the Iguazio platform, then the MLRun service is pre-installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "in order to start working with it you need to run the imports below and set up the following: <br>\n",
    "* MLRun database - set it to the URL of the MLRun database/API service. (When using iguazio the URL of the service can be taken from the services screen in the platform)<br>\n",
    "* Artifact path - In order to store the artifacts you need to set the artifact_path to the desired root folder of your artifacts. <br>\n",
    "Artifacts from each run are stored in the artifact_path which can be set globally through environment var (MLRUN_ARTIFACT_PATH) or through the config, if its not already set we can create a directory and use it in our runs.  <br>\n",
    "Using {{run.uid}} in the path will allow us to create a unique directory per run. <br>\n",
    "You can use {{run.project}} to include the project name in the path. <br>\n",
    "Later on when you run your jobs you can use {{run.uid}} to include the specific run uid in the artifact path. <br>\n",
    "if you don't do that then the jobs artifact will overwrite the old ones. <br>\n",
    "if you want to store a new artifact every time you run your job then use run.uid <br>"
