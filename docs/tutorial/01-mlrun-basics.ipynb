    "MLRun jobs and pipelines run over serverless functions.\n",

    "The spec contains metadata for configuring related operational aspects, such as the image, required packages, CPU/memory/GPU resources, storage, and the environment.\n",

    "Functions are versioned and can be generated from code or notebooks, or loaded from a marketplace.\n",
    "\n",
    "MLRun supports batch functions (for data processing, training, etc.) or real-time functions (for serving, APIs, and stream processing).<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To work with functions you need to be familiar with the following function components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context** &mdash; Functions can be built from standard code files or function handlers, to gain the maximum value we use the job `context` object inside our code, this will allow us to access parameters, data, secrets, etc. as well as log text, files, artifacts, and labels.\n",
    "    - If we specify `context` as the first parameter in our function signature, MLRun will inject the current job context into it\n",
    "    - If we don’t want to change our function we can also obtain the context object using MLRun `get_or_create_ctx()` method.\n",
    "- **Parameters and inputs** &mdash; We can pass `parameters` (arguments) or data `inputs` (such as datasets, feature-vectors, models, or files) to our functions through the `run` method.\n",
    "    - Inside our function we can access the parameters/inputs by simply adding them as parameters to the function or we can get them from the context object (using `get_param()` and ` get_input()`).\n",
    "    - We can use MLRun [Iterative Hyper-Param jobs](../hyper-params.ipynb) to run functions with different parameter and input combinations.\n",
    "    - Various data objects (files, tables, models, etc.) are passed to the function as [`DataItem` objects](../store/datastore.md), data items objects abstract away the data backend implementation, provide a set of convenience methods (`.as_df`, `.get`, `.show`, ..) and enable auto logging/versioning of data and metadata. \n",
