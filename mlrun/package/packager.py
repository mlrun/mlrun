class Packager(ABC, metaclass=_PackagerMeta):
    """
    The abstract base class for a packager. A packager is a static class that has two main duties:

    1. **Packing** - get an object that was returned from a function and log it to MLRun. The user can specify packing
       configurations to the packager using log hints. The packed object can be an artifact or a result.
    2. **Unpacking** - get an :py:meth:`mlrun.DataItem<mlrun.datastore.base.DataItem>` (an input to a MLRun function)
       and parse it to the desired hinted type. The packager uses the instructions it noted itself when originally
       packing the object.

    .. rubric:: Custom Implementation (Inherit Packager)

    The Packager has one class variable and five class methods that must be implemented:

    * :py:meth:`PACKABLE_OBJECT_TYPE<PACKABLE_OBJECT_TYPE>` - A class variable to specify the object type this packager
      handles. Used for the ``is_packable`` and ``repr`` methods. An ellipses (`...`) means any type.
    * :py:meth:`PRIORITY<PRIORITY>` - The priority of this packager among the rest of the packagers. Valid values are
      integers between 1-10 where 1 is the highest priority and 10 is the lowest. If not set, a default priority of 5 is
      set for MLRun builtin packagers and 3 for user custom packagers.
    * :py:meth:`get_default_packing_artifact_type` - A class method to get the default artifact type for packing an
      object when it is not provided by the user.
    * :py:meth:`get_default_unpacking_artifact_type` - A class method to get the default artifact type for unpacking a
      data item when it is not representing a package, but a simple url or an old / manually logged artifact.
    * :py:meth:`get_supported_artifact_types` - A class method to get the supported artifact types this packager can
      pack an object as. Used for the ``is_packable`` and `repr` methods.
    * :py:meth:`pack` - A class method to pack a returned object using the provided log hint configurations while noting
      itself instructions for how to unpack it once needed (only relevant for packed artifacts since results do not need
      unpacking).
    * :py:meth:`unpack` - A class method to unpack an MLRun ``DataItem``, parsing it to its desired hinted type using
      the instructions noted while originally packing it.

    The class methods ``is_packable`` and ``is_unpackable`` are implemented with the following basic logic:

    * :py:meth:`is_packable` - a class method to know whether to use this packager to pack an object by its
      type and artifact type. It compares the object's type with the ``PACKABLE_OBJECT_TYPE`` and checks that the
      artifact type is in the returned supported artifacts list from ``get_supported_artifact_types``.
    * :py:meth:`is_unpackable` - a class method to know whether to use this packager to unpack a data item by the user-
      noted type hint and optionally stored artifact type in the data item (in case it was packaged before). It matches
      the ``PACKABLE_OBJECT_TYPE`` to the type hint given (same logic as IDE matchups, meaning subclasses are
      considered as unpackable) and checks if the artifact type is in the returned supported artifacts list from
      ``get_supported_artifact_types``.

    Preferably, each packager should handle a single type of object.

    .. rubric:: Linking Artifacts (extra data)

    To link between packages (using the extra data or metrics spec attributes of an artifact), use
    the key as if it exists and as value ellipses (...). The manager links all packages once it is done packing.

    For example, given extra data keys in the log hint as `extra_data`, setting them to an artifact would be::

        artifact = Artifact(key="my_artifact")
        artifact.spec.extra_data = {key: ... for key in extra_data}

    .. rubric:: Clearing Outputs

    Some of the packagers may produce files and temporary directories that should be deleted once the artifacts
    are logged. The packager can mark paths of files and directories to delete after logging using the class method
    :py:meth:`add_future_clearing_path`.

    For example, in the following packager's ``pack`` method, you can write a text file, create an Artifact, and
    then mark the text file to be deleted once the artifact is logged::

        with open("./some_file.txt", "w") as file:
            file.write("Pack me")
        artifact = Artifact(key="my_artifact")
        cls.add_future_clearing_path(path="./some_file.txt")
        return artifact, None
