        :param model_path:               Path to the model's directory with the saved '.pt' file. The file must start
                                         with the given model name. The model path can be also passed as a model object

                                         well. The model class must appear in the custom objects / modules map
                                         dictionary / json. If the model path given is of a store object, this model

        :param modules_map:              A dictionary of all the modules required for loading the model. Each key

        :param custom_objects_map:       A dictionary of all the custom objects required for loading the model. Each key
                                         is a path to a python file and its value is the custom object name to import
                                         from it. If multiple objects needed to be imported from the same py file a list
                                         can be given. The map can be passed as a path to a json file as well. For
                                         example:
                                         {

                                         meaning each py file will be read from 'custom_objects_directory/<MAP VALUE>'.
                                         If the model path given is of a store object, the custom objects map will be
                                         read from the logged custom object map artifact of the model.
                                         Notice: The custom objects will be imported in the order they came in this
                                         dictionary (or json). If a custom object is depended on another, make sure to
                                         put it below the one it relies on.
        :param custom_objects_directory: Path to the directory with all the python files required for the custom
                                         objects. Can be passed as a zip file as well (will be extracted during the run
                                         before loading the model). If the model path given is of a store object, the
                                         custom objects files will be read from the logged custom object artifact of the
