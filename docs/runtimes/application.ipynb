    "You can use the {py:meth}`~mlrun.runtimes.ApplicationRuntime` to provide an image that runs on top of your deployed model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The application runtime deploys a user container image (for example, a web application), a port, and a command to run the HTTP server. The runtime is based on top of Nuclio, and adds the application as a side-car to a Nuclio function while the actual function is a reverse proxy to that application. The application runtime can both build the side-car image or use a pre-built image. You can specify the source code, and pull at build-time. An API Gateway, by default, is in front of the application to provide an authentication mechanism; you can disable it to allow free access without authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical use cases are:\n",
    "- Deploy a [Vizro](https://github.com/mckinsey/vizro) dashboard that communicates with an external source (for example, a serving model) to display graphs, data, and inference.\n",
    "- Deploy a model and a UI &mdash; the model serving is the backend and the UI is the side car.\n",
    "- Deploy a fastapi web-server with an MLRun model. In this case, the Nuclio function is a reverse proxy and the user web-app is the side car.\n",
