storey.transformations - Graph transformations
==============================================

Graph transformations are contained in the :py:mod:`storey.transformations` module. For convenience, they
can also be imported directly from the ``storey`` package. Note that the transformation functions are actually
encapsulated in classes, so that they can be referenced by name of class from graph step definitions.
