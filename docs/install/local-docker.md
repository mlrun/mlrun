# Install MLRun locally using Docker

ou can install and use MLRun and Nuclio locally on your computer. This does not include all the services and elastic 
scaling capabilities, which you can get with the Kubernetes based deployment, but it is much simpler to start with.

```{admonition} Note
- Using Docker is limited to local, Nuclio, and Serving runtimes and local pipelines.
```

Use [`docker compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to install MLRun. It deploys the MLRun service,
MLRun UI, Nuclio serverless engine, and optionally the Jupyter server.

There are two installation options:
- [**Use MLRun with your own client (PyCharm, VSCode, Jupyter)**](#use-mlrun-with-your-own-client)
- [**Use MLRun with MLRun Jupyter image (pre loaded with examples/demos)**](#use-mlrun-with-mlrun-jupyter-image)

In both cases you need to set the `SHARED_DIR` environment variable to point to a host path for storing MLRun artifacts and DB, 
for example `export SHARED_DIR=~/mlrun-data` (or use `set SHARED_DIR=c:\mlrun-data` in windows), make sure the directory exists.

It is recommended to set the `HOST_IP` variable with your computer IP address (required for Nuclio dashboard). 
You can select a specific MLRun version with the `TAG` variable and Nuclio version with the `NUCLIO_TAG` variable.

Add the `-d` flag to `docker-compose` for running in detached mode (in the background).

## Use MLRun with your own client

The following commands install MLRun + Nuclio for work with your own IDE or notebook. 

Download the {Download}`compose.yaml<./compose.yaml>` file to the working dir and type:
````{toggle} view compose.yaml
   ```{literalinclude} ./compose.yaml
   :language: yaml
   ```
````

````{tabbed} Linux/Mac
```sh
export SHARED_DIR=~/mlrun-data
export HOST_IP=<your host IP address>
docker-compose -f compose.yaml up
``` 

Your `HOST_IP` address can be found using the `ip addr` or `ifconfig` commands, it is recomended to select an address which does not change dynamically (for example the IP of the bridge interface).
````

````{tabbed} Windows
```sh
set SHARED_DIR=c:\mlrun-data
set HOST_IP=<your host IP address>
docker-compose -f compose.yaml up
``` 

Your `HOST_IP` address can be found using the `ipconfig` shell command, it is recomended to select an address which does not change dynamically (for example the IP of the `vEthernet` interface).
````

This will create 3 services:
1. MLRun API (in `http://localhost:8080`)
2. MLRun UI (in `http://localhost:8060`)
3. Nuclio Dashboard/controller (in `http://localhost:8070`)

After installing MLRun service, set your client environment to work with the service, by setting the MLRun path env variable to 
`MLRUN_DBPATH=http://localhost:8080` or using `.env` files (see [setting client environment](./remote.md)).

## Use MLRun with MLRun Jupyter image

For the quickest experience with MLRun you can deploy MLRun with a pre integrated Jupyter server loaded with various ready-to-use MLRun examples.

Download the {Download}`compose.with-jupyter.yaml<./compose.with-jupyter.yaml>` file to the working dir and type:
````{toggle} show compose.with-jupyter.yaml
   ```{literalinclude} ./compose.with-jupyter.yaml
   :language: yaml
   ```
````

````{tabbed} Linux/Mac
```sh
export SHARED_DIR=~/mlrun-data
export HOST_IP=<your host IP address>
docker-compose -f compose.with-jupyter.yaml up
```

Your `HOST_IP` address can be found using the `ip addr` or `ifconfig` commands, it is recomended to select an address which does not change dynamically (for example the IP of the bridge interface). 
````

````{tabbed} Windows
```sh
set SHARED_DIR=c:\mlrun-data
set HOST_IP=<your host IP address>
docker-compose -f compose.with-jupyter.yaml up
``` 

Your `HOST_IP` address can be found using the `ipconfig` shell command, it is recomended to select an address which does not change dynamically (for example the IP of the `vEthernet` interface).
````

> - Add the `-d` flag to `docker-compose` for running in detached mode (run in the background).

This creates 4 services:
1. Jupyter lab (in `http://localhost:8888`)
1. MLRun API (in `http://localhost:8080`), running on the Jupyter container
2. MLRun UI (in `http://localhost:8060`)
3. Nuclio Dashboard/controller (in `http://localhost:8070`)

After the installation, access the Jupyter server (in [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888)) and run through the `quick-start` tutorial and `demos`.
You can see the projects, tasks, and artifacts in MLRun UI (in [http://localhost:8060](http://localhost:8060))

The Jupyter environment is pre-configured to work with the local MLRun and Nuclio services. 
You can switch to a remote or managed MLRun cluster by editing the `mlrun.env` file in the Jupyter files tree.

The artifacts and DB are stored under **/home/jovyan/data** (`/data` in Jupyter tree).
