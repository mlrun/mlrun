    "Model Monitoring is based on Iguazio's streaming technology. Contact Iguazio to enable this feature.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "MLRun provides a model monitoring service that tracks the performance of models in production to help identify\n",
    "potential issues with concept drift and prediction accuracy before they impact business goals.\n",
    "Typically, Model monitoring is used by devops for tracking model performance, and by data scientists to track model drift.\n",
    "Two monitoring types are supported:\n",
    "1. Model operational performance (stream processing)\n",
    "2. Concept drift detection and accuracy monitoring (features/labels/predictions)\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Monitoring also provides warning alerts that can be sent to stakeholders for processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Model Monitoring feature data can be viewed using Iguazio's user interface portal or through Grafana Dashboards.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture\n",
    "The Model Monitoring process flow starts by collecting operational data, converts them to vectors which are then posted to the Model Server.\n",
    "Then, the Model Server is wrapped around a machine learning model that uses a function to calculate predictions based on the available vectors.\n",
    "Next, the Model Server creates a log for the input and output of the vectors, and the entries are written to the production data stream.\n",
    "While the Model Server is processing the vectors, a Nuclio operation monitors the log of the data stream and is triggered when a new log entry is detected.\n",
    "The Nuclio function examines the log entry, processes it in to statistics which are then written to the statistics databases.\n",
    "In parallel, a scheduled MLRun runs and reads the parquet files performing the drift analysis which is then stored so that\n",
    "the user can retrieve the analysis data in the Iguazio UI or in a Grafana dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Architecture](./model-monitoring-data-flow.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Endpoints Overview Dashboard\n",
    "The Overview dashboard will display the model endpoint IDs of a specific project. Only deployed models with Model Monitoring option enabled are displayed.\n",
    "Endpoint IDs are URIs used to provide access to performance data, drift detection statistics, and accuracy monitoring of a deployed model.\n",
    "\n",
    "![overview](./overview.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Overview screen providers details about the performance of all the deployed and monitored models within a project. You can change projects by choosing a new project from the\n",
    "**Project** dropdown. The Overview dashboard displays the number of endpoints in the project, the average predictions per second (using a 5-minute rolling average),\n",
    "the average latency (using a 1-hour rolling average), and the total error count in the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional details include:\n",
    "* **Endpoint ID**&mdash;the ID of the deployed model. Use this link to drill down to the model performance and details screens.\n",
    "* **Function**&mdash;the MLRun function to access the model\n",
    "* **Model**&mdash;user defined name for the model\n",
    "* **Model Class**&mdash;the implementation class that is used by the endpoint\n",
    "* **First Request**&mdash;first request for production data\n",
    "* **Last Request**&mdash;most recent request for production data\n",
    "* **Error count**&mdash;total error count from processing production data\n",
    "* **Accuracy**&mdash;a numeric value representing the accuracy of model predictions\n",
    "* **Drift Status**&mdash;no drift (green), possible drift (yellow), drift detected (red)\n",
    "\n",
    "At the bottom of the dashboard are heat maps for the Predictions per second, Average Latency and Errors. The heat maps display data based on 15 minute intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Click an endpoint ID to drill down the performance details of that model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Endpoint Details Dashboard\n",
    "The model endpoint details dashboard displays the real time performance data of the selected model in detail.\n",
    "Model performance data provided is rich and is used to fine tune or diagnose potential performance issues that may affect business goals.\n",
    "The data in this dashboard changes based on the selection of the project and model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dashboard is broken down into three panes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Project and model summary](#project-and-model-summary)\n",
    "2. [Analysis panes](#analysis-panes)\n",
    "   1. Overall drift analysis\n",
    "   2. Features analysis\n",
    "3. [Incoming features graph](#incoming-features-graph)\n",
    "\n",
    "![details](./details.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project and Model Summary\n",
    "Use the dropdown to change the project and model. The dashboard presents the following information about the project:\n",
    "* **Endpoint ID**&mdash;the ID of the deployed model\n",
    "* **Model**&mdash;user defined name for the model\n",
    "* **Function URI**&mdash;the MLRun function to access the model\n",
    "* **Model Class**&mdash;the implementation class that is used by the endpoint\n",
    "* **Prediction/s**&mdash;the average number of predictions per second over a rolling 5-minute period\n",
    "* **Average Latency**&mdash;the average latency over a rolling 1-hour period\n",
    "* **First Request**&mdash;first request for production data\n",
    "* **Last Request**&mdash;most recent request for production data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the [Performance](#model-endpoint-performance-dashboard) and [Overview](#model-endpoints-overview-dashboard) buttons view those dashboards.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis Panes\n",
    "This pane is broken down into sections: Overall Drift Analysis and Features Analysis.\n",
    "Concept Drift in machine learning is a situation where the statistical properties of the target variable (what the model is trying to predict) change over time.\n",
    "In other words, the production data has changed significantly over the course of time and no longer matches the input data used to train the model.\n",
    "So, for this new data, accuracy of the model predictions is low.\n",
    "For more information see <a href=\"https://www.iguazio.com/glossary/concept-drift/\" target=\"_blank\">Concept Drift</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Overall Drift Analysis pane provides performance statistics for the currently selected model. This pane includes three types of statistics:\n",
    "* **Total Variation Distance** (TVD sum and mean)&mdash;this is the statistical difference between the actual predictions, and the model's trained predictions\n",
    "* **Hellinger Distance** (sum and mean)&mdash;this is a type of f-divergence that quantifies the similarity between the actual predictions, and the model's trained predictions.\n",
    "* **Kullback–Leibler Divergence** (KLD sum and mean)&mdash;this is the measure of how the probability distribution of actual predictions is different from the second, model's trained reference probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Features Analysis pane provides details of the drift analysis for each feature in the selected model.\n",
    "This pane includes five types of statistics:\n",
    "* **Actual** (min, mean and max)&mdash;results based on actual live data stream\n",
    "* **Expected** (min, mean and max)&mdash;results based on training data\n",
    "* **Total Variation Distance** (TVD)&mdash;this is the statistical difference between the actual predictions, and the model's trained predictions\n",
    "* **Hellinger Distance**&mdash;this is a type of f-divergence that quantifies the similarity between the actual predictions, and the model's trained predictions.\n",
    "* **Kullback–Leibler Divergence** (KLD)&mdash;this is the measure of how the probability distribution of actual predictions is different from the second, model's trained reference probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Incoming Features Graph\n",
    "This graph displays the performance of the features that are in the selected model based on sampled data points from actual feature production data.\n",
    "The graph displays the values of the features in the model over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Endpoint Performance Dashboard\n",
    "Model endpoint performance displays performance details in graphical format.\n",
    "\n",
    "![performance](./performance.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This dashboard is broken down into 5 graphs:\n",
    "* **Drift Measures**&mdash;the overall drift over time for each of the endpoints in the selected model\n",
    "* **Average Latency**&mdash;the average latency of the model in 5 minute intervals, for 5 minutes and 1 hour rolling windows\n",
    "* **Predictions/s**&mdash;the model predictions per second displayed in 5 second intervals for 5 minutes (rolling)\n",
    "* **Predictions Count**&mdash;the number of predictions the model makes for 5 minutes and 1 hour rolling windows\n",
    "\n",
