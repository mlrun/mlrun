    "This part of the MLRun getting-started tutorial walks you through the steps for working with projects, source control (git), and automating the ML pipeline.\n",

    "MLRun Project is a container for all your work on a particular activity: all the associated code, functions, \n",
    "jobs/workflows and artifacts. Projects can be mapped to `git` repositories to enable versioning, collaboration, and CI/CD.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create project definitions using the SDK or a yaml file and store those in MLRun DB, file, or archive.\n",
    "Once the project is loaded you can run jobs/workflows which refer to any project element by name, allowing separation between configuration and code. See the [Projects, Automation & CI/CD](../projects/overview.md) section for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Projects contain `workflows` that execute the registered functions in a sequence/graph (DAG), and which can reference project parameters, secrets and artifacts by name. MLRun currently supports two workflow engines, `local` (for simple tasks) and [Kubeflow Pipelines](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/pipelines/pipelines-quickstart/) (for more complex/advanced tasks). MLRun also supports a real-time workflow engine (see [MLRun serving graphs](../serving/serving-graph.md)). \n",

    "- **`init_git`** &mdash; set to `True` to perform Git initialization of the project directory (`context`) in case its not initialized.\n",
