# Functions

All the executions in MLRun are based on **Serverless Functions**. The functions allow specifying code and 
all the operational aspects (image, required packages, [cpu/mem/gpu resources](node-affinity), [storage](function-storage), environment, etc.). 
The [different function runtimes](Function_runtimes) take care of automatically transforming the code and spec to fully 
managed and elastic services over Kubernetes, which saves significant operational overhead, 
addresses scalability and reduces infrastructure costs.

MLRun supports:
- Real-time functions for: serving, APIs, and stream processing (based on the high-performance Nuclio engine). 
- Batch functions (based on Kubernetes jobs, Spark, Dask, Horovod, etc.)

Function objects are all inclusive (code, spec, API, and metadata definitions), which allows placing them 
in a shared and versioned function market place. This means that different members of the team can produce or 
consume functions. Each function is versioned and stored in the MLRun database with a unique hash code, 
and gets a new hash code upon changes.

MLRun supports:
- [Multiple types of runtimes](../concepts/functions-overview).
- Configuring the function resources (replicas, CPU/GPU/memory limits, volumes, Spot vs. On-demand nodes, pod priority, node affinity). See details in [Managing job resources](configuring-job-resources). 
- Iterative tasks for automatic and distributed execution of many tasks with variable parameters (hyperparams). See [Hyperparam and iterative jobs](../hyper-params).
- Horizontal scaling of functions across multiple containers. See [Distributed and Parallel Jobs](./distributed.md).

MLRun has an open [public marketplace](https://www.mlrun.org/marketplace/functions/) that stores many pre-developed functions for
use in your projects.
