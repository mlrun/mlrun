<!-- Really Specific - Maybe not for Glossary?	
ACCESS_KEY 	Some kind of authentication - no context for what this is
ctx 	Common abbreviation for context - should be evident from code
HTTPRunDB 	 API for wrapper to the internal DB in MLRun - really specific?
Event 	 part of streaming ... relation of event to row in FeatureSet - really specific?
hub 	Used in code to reference MLRun Marketplace -->
