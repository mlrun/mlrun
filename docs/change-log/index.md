|ML-4053|Pre-v1.4.0: When logging artifacts during a runtime (regular artifacts, not models (ModelArtifact via context.log_model) or datasets (DatasetArtifact via context.log_dataset)), they were strings in the RunObject outputs property. The strings were the target path to the file logged in the artifact. From v1.4.0, they are the store path of the artifact, and not the target path. (They now appear the same as the store paths for logging models and datasets.) This is breaking behavior only if you use the output of the run object as a parameter to another runtime and not as an input. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/pull/3333). |

```
 # Set 2 functions:
func1 = project.set_function(...)
func2 = project.set_function(...)

# Run the first function:
run1 = func1.run(...)
# In the function  `func1` we logged a model "my_model" and an artifact "my_artifact"
run1.outputs  
{
    "my_model": "store://...",
    "my_artifact": "store://...",  # Instead of target path: "/User/.../data.csv"
}

# The function `func2` expects a `DataItem` for the logged artifact so passing it through inputs will work as `DataItem` can work with store paths:
run2 = func2.run(..., inputs={"artifact": run1.outputs["my_artifact"]})

# But passing it through a parameter won't work as the string value is now a store path and not a target path:
run2 = func2.run(..., params={"artifact": run1.outputs["my_artifact"]})

### Documentation
New sections describing [Git best practices](../projects/git-best-practices.html) and an example [Nuclio function](../concepts/nuclio-real-time-functions.html#example-of-nuclio-function).

## v1.3.0 (22 March 2023)

### Client/server matrix, prerequisites, and installing

The MLRun server is now based on Python 3.9. It's recommended to move the client to Python 3.9 as well. 

MLRun v1.3.0 maintains support for mlrun base images that are based on python 3.7. To differentiate between the images, the images based on
python 3.7 have the suffix: `-py37`. The correct version is automatically chosen for the built-in MLRun images according to the Python version of the MLRun client (for example, a 3.7 Jupyter gets the `-py37` images).

MLRun v1.3.x maintains support for mlrun base images that are based on a python 3.7 environment. To differentiate between the images, the images based on
python 3.7 have the suffix: `-py37`. The correct version is automatically chosen for the built-in MLRun images according to the Python version of the MLRun client (for example, a 3.7 Jupyter gets the `-py37` images).

For a Python 3.9 environment see [Set up a Python 3.9 client environment](../install/remote.html#set-up-a-python-3-9-client-environment).

#### Set up a Python 3.7 client environment (Iguazio versions up to and including v3.5.2) 

```{admonition} Note
There is a known bug with nbformat on the Jupyter version in Iguazio up to and including v3.5.2, 
which requires upgrading nbformat to 5.7.0. When using an older nbformat, some Jupyter Notebooks do not open.
```

To install on a **Python 3.7** environment (and optionally upgrade to python 3.9 environment):
  
1. Configure the Jupyter service with the env variable `JUPYTER_PREFER_ENV_PATH=false`.
2. Within the Jupyter service, open a terminal and update conda and pip to have an up-to-date pip resolver.

```
$CONDA_HOME/bin/conda install -y conda=23.1.0 	
$CONDA_HOME/bin/conda install -y 'pip>=22.0'
$CONDA_HOME/bin/conda install -y nbformat=5.7.0
```
3. If you want to upgrade to a Python 3.9 environment, create a new conda env and activate it:
```
conda create -n python39 python=3.9 ipykernel -y
conda activate python39
```
4. Install mlrun:
```
./align_mlrun.sh
```

|ML-2732|The new log collection service improves the performance and reduces heavy IO operations from the API container. The new MLRun log collector service is a gRPC server, which runs as sidecar in the mlrun-api pod (chief and worker). The service is responsible for collecting logs from run pods, writing to persisted files, and reading them on request. The new service is transparent to the end-user: there are no UI or API changes. |

### Breaking changes 


- The behavior of ingest with aggregation changed in v1.3.0 (storey, spark, pandas engines). Now, when you ingest a "timestamp" column, it returns <br>
`<class 'pandas._libs.tslibs.timestamps.Timestamp'>`. <br>Previously, it returned `<class 'str'>`
- Any target data that was saved using Redis as an online target with storey engine (RedisNoSql target, introduced in 1.2.1) is not accessible after upgrading to v1.3. (Data ingested subsequent to the upgrade is unaffacted.)

### Deprecated and removed APIs
Starting with v1.3.0, and continuing in subsequent releases, obsolete functions are getting removed from the code. See [Deprecations and removed code](#deprecations-and-removed-code).

### New and updated features

#### Feature store
- Supports ingesting Avro-encoded Kafka records. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/issues/2649).

#### Third party integrations
- Supports Confluent Kafka as a feature store data-source (Tech Preview). See [Confluent Kafka data source](../data-prep/ingest-data-fs.html#confluent-kafka-data-source).
    
### Closed issues

- Fix: the **Projects|Jobs|Monitor Workflows** view is now accurate when filtering for > 1 hour. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/pull/2786).
- The Kubernetes **Pods** tab in **Monitor Workflows** now shows the complete pod details. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/pull/1576).
- Update the tooltips in **Projects|Jobs|Schedule** to explain that day 0 (for cron jobs) is Monday, and not Sunday. 
[View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/ui/pull/1571).
- Fix UI crash when selecting **All** in the **Tag** dropdown list of the **Projects|Feature Store|Feature Vectors** tab. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/ui/pull/1549).
- Fix: now updates `next_run_time` when skipping scheduling due to concurrent runs. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/pull/2862).
- When creating a project, the error `NotImplementedError` was updated to explain that MLRun does not have a 
DB to connect to. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/pull/2856).

## v1.2.0 (1 December 2022)

### New and updated features

#### Artifacts
- Support for artifact tagging:
   - SDK: Add `tag_artifacts`  and `delete_artifacts_tags` that can be used to modify existing artifacts tags and have 
    more than one version for an artifact.
    - UI: You can add and edit artifact tags in the UI.
    - API: Introduce new endpoints in `/projects/<project>/tags`.
    
#### Auth
- Support S3 profile and assume-role when using `fsspec`.
- Support GitHub fine grained tokens.

#### Documentation
- Restructured, and added new content.

#### Feature store
- Support Redis as an online feature set for storey engine only. (See [Redis target store](../data-prep/ingest-data-fs.html#redis-target-store).)
- Fully supports ingesting with pandas engine, now equivalent to ingestion with `storey` engine (TechPreview):
   - Support DataFrame with multi-index.
   - Support mlrun steps when using pandas engine: `OneHotEncoder` , `DateExtractor`, `MapValue`, `Imputer` and `FeatureValidation`.
- Add new step: `DropFeature` for pandas and storey engines. (TechPreview)
- Add param query for `get_offline_feature` for filtering the output.

#### Frameworks
- Add `HuggingFaceModelServer` to `mlrun.frameworks` at `mlrun.frameworks.huggingface` to serve `HuggingFace` models.

#### Functions
- Add `function.with_annotations({"framework":"tensorflow"})` to user-created functions.
- Add `overwrite_build_params` to `project.build_function()` so the user can choose whether or not to keep the 
build params that were used in previous function builds.
- `deploy_function` has a new option of mock deployment that allows running the function locally.

#### Installation
- New option to install `google-cloud` requirements using `mlrun[google-cloud]`:  when installing MLRun for integration 
with GCP clients, only compatible packages are installed.

#### Models
- The Labels in the **Models > Overview** tab can be edited.



#### Internal
- Refactor artifacts endpoints to follow the MLRun convention of `/projects/<project>/artifacts/...`. (The previous API will be deprecated in a future release.)
- Add `/api/_internal/memory-reports/` endpoints for memory related metrics to better understand the memory consumption of the API.
- Improve the HTTP retry mechanism.
- Support a new lightweight mechanism for KFP pods to pull the run state they triggered. Default behavior is legacy, 
which pulls the logs of the run to figure out the run state. 
The new behavior can be enabled using a feature flag configured in the API.

### Breaking changes

- Feature store: Ingestion using pandas now takes the dataframe and creates indices out of the entity column 
(and removes it as a column in this df). This could cause breakage for existing custom steps when using a pandas engine.

### Closed issues

- Support logging artifacts larger than 5GB to V3IO. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/issues/2455).
- Limit KFP to kfp~=1.8.0, <1.8.14 due to non-backwards changes done in 1.8.14 for ParallelFor, which isn’t compatible with the MLRun managed KFP server (1.8.1). [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/issues/2516).
- Add `artifact_path` enrichment from project `artifact_path`. Previously, the parameter wasn't applied to project runs when defining `project.artifact_path`. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/issues/2507).
- Align timeouts for requests that are getting re-routed from worker to chief (for projects/background related endpoints). [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/issues/2565).
- Fix legacy artifacts load when loading a project. Fixed corner cases when legacy artifacts were saved to yaml and loaded back into the system using `load_project()`. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/issues/2584).
- Fix artifact `latest` tag enrichment to happen also when user defined a specific tag. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/issues/2572).
- Fix zip source extraction during function build. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/issues/2588).
- Fix Docker compose deployment so Nuclio is configured properly with a platformConfig file that sets proper mounts and network 
configuration for Nuclio functions, meaning that they run in the same network as MLRun. 
[View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/issues/2601).
- Workaround for background tasks getting cancelled prematurely, due to the current FastAPI version that 
has a bug in the starlette package it uses. The bug caused the task to get cancelled if the client’s HTTP connection 
was closed before the task was done. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/issues/2618).
- Fix run fails after deploying function without defined image. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/pull/2530).
- Fix scheduled jobs failed on GKE with resource quota error. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/pull/2520).
- Can now delete a model via tag. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/pull/2433).

## v1.1.3 (28 December 2022)

### Closed issues

- The CLI supports overwriting the schedule when creating scheduling workflow. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/pull/2651).

- Timeout is executed properly when running a pipeline in CLI. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/pull/2635).
- Uvicorn Keep Alive Timeout (`http_connection_timeout_keep_alive`) is now configurable, with default=11. This maintains 
API-client connections. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/pull/2613).

## v1.1.0 (6 September 2022)

### New and updated features

#### API
-  MLRun scalability: Workers are used to handle the connection to the MLRun database and can be increased to 
improve handling of high workloads against the MLRun DB. You can configure the number of workers for an MLRun 
service, which is applied to the service's user-created pods. The default is 2. 
   - v1.1.0 cannot run on top of 3.0.x.
   - For Iguazio versions prior to v3.5.0, the number of workers is set to 1 by default. To change this number, contact support (helm-chart change required).
   - Multi-instance is not supported for MLrun running on SQLite.
-  Supports pipeline scheduling.
      
#### Documentation

- You can add a time-based filter condition when running `get_offline_feature` with a given vector. 

#### Storey
- MLRun can write to parquet with flexible schema per batch for ParquetTarget: useful for inconsistent or unknown schema.

#### UI

- The **Projects** home page now has three tiles, Data, Jobs and Workflows, Deployment, that guide you through key 
capabilities of Iguazio, and provide quick access to common tasks.

## v1.0.6 (16 August 2022)

### Closed issues
- Import from mlrun fails with "ImportError: cannot import name dataclass_transform".
   Workaround for previous releases:
   Install `pip install pydantic==1.9.2` after `align_mlrun.sh`.
- MLRun FeatureSet was not enriching with security context when running from the UI. [View in Git](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/pull/2250).
