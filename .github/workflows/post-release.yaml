  trigger-build-workflow:
    # When the build workflow is triggered for a commit to development it builds the images and (docker) tag them with
    # <latest-released-version>-<commit-hash>.
    # When the periodic system tests workflow runs, it gets the latest commit from development, and searches for the
    # relevant tag.
    # Therefore, when a new version is released, any system test that will run after it, and before a new commit to
    # development was done, will search for a docker tag that doesn't exist.
    # In order to solve that we trigger the build workflow on the development branch when we release a new version
