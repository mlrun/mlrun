    An abstract class for enriching an object interface with the properties, methods and functions written below.

    A class inheriting MLRun interface should insert what ever it needs to be inserted to the object to the following
    attributes: '_PROPERTIES', '_METHODS' and '_FUNCTIONS'. Then it should implement 'add_interface' and call 'super'.

    In order to replace object's attributes, the attributes to replace are needed to be added to the attributes:
    '_REPLACED_PROPERTIES', '_REPLACED_METHODS' and '_REPLACED_FUNCTIONS'. The original attribute will be kept in a
    backup attribute with the prefix noted in '_ORIGINAL_ATTRIBUTE_NAME'. Replacing functions / methods will be the one
    located by looking for the prefix noted in '_REPLACING_ATTRIBUTE_NAME'. The replacing function / method can be a
    MLRunInterface class method that return a function / method.

    For example: if "x" is in the list then the method "object.x" will be stored as "object.original_x" and "object.x"
    will then point to the method "MLRunInterface.mlrun_x". If "mlrun_x" is a class method, it will point to the
    function returned from MLRunInterface.mlrun_x()".
