# Ingest and process data

MLRun provides a set of tools and capabilities to streamline the task of data ingestion and processing. For an 
end-to-end framework for data processing, management, and serving, MLRun has the feature-store capabilities, which are
described in {ref}`feature-store`. However, in many cases the full feature-store capabilities are 
not needed, in which cases MLRun provides a set of utilities to facilitate data ingestion, collection and processing.
