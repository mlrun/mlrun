    "the average latency (using a 1-hour rolling average), and the total error count in the project.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### How to read a heat map\n",
    "Heat maps are used to analyze trends and to instantly transform and enhance data through visualizations. This helps to quickly identify areas of interest,\n",
    "and empower users to explore the data in order to pinpoint where there may be potential issues. A heat map uses a matrix layout with colour and shading to show the relationship between\n",
    "two categories of values (x and y axes), so the darker the cell, the higher the value. The values presented along each axis correspond to a cell which is color-coded to represent the relationship between\n",
    "the two categories. The Predictions per second heatmap shows the relationship between time, and the predictions per second, and the Average Latency per hour shows the relationship between\n",
    "time and the latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "To properly read the heap maps, follow the hierarchy of shades from the darkest (the highest values) to the lightest shades (the lowest values).\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
