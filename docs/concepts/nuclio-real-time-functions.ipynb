    "Nuclio is a high-performance \"serverless\" framework focused on data, I/O, and compute intensive workloads. It is well integrated with popular \n",
    "data science tools, such as Jupyter and Kubeflow; supports a variety of data and streaming sources; and supports execution over CPUs and GPUs. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can use Nuclio through a fully managed application service (in the cloud or on-prem) in the Iguazio MLOps Platform. MLRun serving \n",
    "utilizes serverless Nuclio functions to create multi-stage real-time pipelines. \n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying Nuclio serverless engine uses a high-performance parallel processing engine that maximizes the utilization of CPUs and GPUs, \n",
    "supports 13 protocols and invocation methods (for example, HTTP, Cron, Kafka, Kinesis), and includes dynamic auto-scaling for HTTP and \n",
    "streaming. Nuclio and MLRun support the full life cycle, including auto-generation of micro-services, APIs, load-balancing, logging, \n",
    "monitoring, and configuration managementâ€”such that developers can focus on code, and deploy to production faster with minimal work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nuclio is extremely fast: a single function instance can process hundreds of thousands of HTTP requests or data records per second. To learn \n",
    "more about how Nuclio works, see the Nuclio architecture [documentation](https://nuclio.io/docs/latest/concepts/architecture/). \n",
    "\n",
    "Nuclio is secure: Nuclio is integrated with Kaniko to allow a secure and production-ready way of building Docker images at run time.\n",

    "Read more in the [Nuclio documentation](https://nuclio.io/docs/latest/) and the open-source [MLRun library](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun).\n",

    "## Example of Nuclio function\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create your own Nuclio function, for example a data processing function. For every Nuclio function, by default, there is one worker. See [Number of GPUs](../runtimes/configuring-job-resources.html#number-of-gpus).\n",
